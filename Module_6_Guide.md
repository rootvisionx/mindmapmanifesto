## What is RTT®?

Rapid Transformational Therapy® is a therapeutic approach that combines elements of hypnotherapy, CBT, psychotherapy, NLP, and healing into a unique, powerful methodology developed by Marisa Peer over 30 years of practice.

### The Three-Part RTT® Process

**Part 1: Finding the 'Why'**
- Why are you like this?
- How did you become the person you are?
- What happened and when did you start feeling this way?

**Part 2: Extraction and Replacement**
Like a dentist, the RTT® professional:
- Removes negative habits and beliefs
- Replaces them with new, beneficial behaviors and beliefs
- Integrates everything to function better than before

**Part 3: Wiring In Changes**
Through the personalized Transformation recording:
- Rewires beliefs about self
- Teaches clients to dialogue with themselves constructively
- Creates a supportive inner voice that acts as cheerleader, best friend, devoted parent, and ally

### How RTT® Differs from Other Therapies

**Unlike Traditional Hypnotherapy:**
- Goes beyond positive reinforcement
- Reaches breakthroughs that wouldn't be possible through talk therapy alone
- Accesses and fixes blocks in the subconscious mind

**Unlike CBT and Talk Therapy:**
- Achieves outstanding results very quickly (typically 1-3 sessions)
- Gets to the root cause rather than just addressing symptoms
- Creates permanent, powerful change

**Unlike NLP:**
- Directly accesses and fixes blocks that are present
- Includes the crucial Transformation recording component
- Provides more comprehensive transformational techniques

### Core Principles

- Understanding is power - once clients understand the cause of a barrier, they can free themselves
- The mind can tell the body what to do (Command Cell Therapy)
- Neuroplasticity proves we can rewire our minds
- We don't need weekly sessions or a lifetime to change the mind's processes

## The 4 I's: RTT® Session Framework

The 4 I's provide the structure for RTT® sessions:

1. **INVESTIGATE**
2. **INTERPRET**
3. **INTERRUPT**
4. **INSTALL**

### Setting the Client Up for Success

Before beginning the session proper, address client concerns:
- Explain what hypnosis is and dispel misconceptions
- Reassure them that RTT® will work for them
- Build confidence through "convincers" (demonstrating suggestibility)
- Create success by addressing fears before the Induction begins

This preparatory work may be the most critical time for creating session success.

---

## Stage 1: INVESTIGATE

**Purpose:** Help clients understand the root cause of their issue and identify the meaning they've attached to past events that created limiting beliefs.

### Key Outcomes
- Understand the client's presenting problem and how it affects their life
- Discover what the client wants and what life looks like without the problem
- Uncover the root cause and why the issue started

### Tools Used in Investigation

#### 1. Intake and Consultation (20 minutes)

**Key Actions:**
- Explain that clients can talk during the session and are never out of control
- Request permission for physical contact (if in person)
- Review the Intake and Consultation form
- Identify symptoms, triggers, and habits
- Explore childhood - parents, siblings, traumas
- **Magic Wand Question:** "If I could wave a magic wand and do one thing for you today, what would it be?"
- Determine "Life Without the Problem"
- Check suggestibility
- Conduct Rapid Eye Movement Test

#### 2. Induction into Hypnosis

A single rapid induction technique involving:
- Inward focus
- Relaxation
- Rapid Eye Movement (REM)

**Process:**
- Client looks up until slight eye strain
- Eyes close with fluttering sensation (REM)
- Guide client down ten steps, becoming more relaxed with each
- Use deepening techniques at the final step

#### 3. Suggestibility Tests and Deepeners

**Suggestibility Tests** (demonstrate the power of the mind):

**Bucket and Balloon**
- Arms extended as if holding bike handlebars
- Right hand: huge helium balloon lifting arm up
- Left hand: bucket of heavy wet sand dragging arm down

**Attracting Magnets**
- Arms extended with palms facing each other
- Powerful magnet in each palm
- Magnets draw hands together

**Deepening Techniques:**
- Clicking fingers while saying "Go deeper"
- "Your eyes are heavy and sealed shut"
- Gently lifting and shaking arm
- Gently rocking head (maximum 10 seconds)
- Hypnotic surrender - pushing hands into lap

#### 4. The Detective Work and Daisy-Chaining

**Purpose:** Guide clients to significant events from earlier in life that contributed to their presenting problem.

**Process:**
- Go to at least three scenes
- Solidify each scene: inside/outside, who's present, age, location, what's happening
- Focus on what they're seeing, hearing, feeling, experiencing
- Tap forehead (1-2 short taps) to associate them into the scene
- Link scenes together (Daisy-chaining)
- The last scene is usually most significant/emotionally intense

**If No Scenes Appear:**
- Focus on the feeling: "Let's talk about the feeling. What's the feeling?"
- Use Child in the Room tool
- Use RFPI to get more information

#### 5. Child in the Room

**When to Use:** When clients don't see scenes or scenes are unclear

**Purpose:** A guided visualization connecting clients to their emotions to trigger memories of events, ideas, and feelings from earlier in life.

**Process:**
- Use feelings that emerge to return to The Detective Work
- Attempt to get more scenes if possible
- Not necessary if client already went back to scenes in The Detective Work

---

## Stage 2: INTERPRET

**Purpose:** Help clients see how the meaning they attached to past events has led to what they feel, think, and believe about themselves today.

### Key Outcomes
- Connect scenes from the past to the present issue
- Reveal conclusions, beliefs, meanings, and interpretations attached to past events
- Show how childhood responses made sense then but don't serve them now as adults
- Find the Role, Function, Purpose, and Intention of the issue

### Tools Used in Interpretation

#### 1. Left Hand/Right Hand

**Purpose:** Review scenes with the client and explore the meaning attached to each.

**Process:**
- Place all past scenes in left hand (as DVD movies or snapshots)
- Place current issue in right hand
- Review each scene: "In Scene 1, this is what happened..."
- Ask client to explain how past scenes (left hand) led to current issue (right hand)

**Remember:** Left = past/letting go; Right = present/making it right

**Key Principle:** The interpretation and meaning of an event is what hurts the client. Your job is to help them understand this without leading or making assumptions - they will make sense of the scenes themselves.

#### 2. Role, Function, Purpose, Intention (RFPI)

**One of the most useful techniques** - uncovers root cause through probing and questioning.

**Purpose:**
- Uncover why a physical/emotional issue came into the client's life
- Understand what it's trying to do for them
- Show that if they created the issue, they can transform it
- Get client to acknowledge they don't need the belief/behavior anymore

**Note:** This is a powerful, confrontational part where clients come to terms with aspects that made them unhappy/unwell, often resulting in a "lightbulb moment."

---

## Stage 3: INTERRUPT

**Purpose:** Interrupt limiting beliefs by reframing and reminding clients they are no longer dependent children - they have a voice, they are powerful, and everything is available to them.

### Key Outcomes
- Help clients interrupt their beliefs
- Reframe beliefs
- Show they are no longer children
- Teach them they can meet their own needs now

### Tools Used in Interruption

#### 1. It's Not Me

**Purpose:** Change the client's beliefs through powerful reframing.

**Process:**
- Client emphasizes why they no longer identify with past experiences, feelings, and behaviors
- Client understands the role these played and that they were age-appropriate at the time
- Powerful way of breaking old beliefs

#### 2. Dialogue With the Hurter

**When to Use:** Only when appropriate

**Purpose:** Allow clients to gain insight and take back their power.

**Process:**
- Client talks out loud to the person who hurt them
- Client switches places and becomes the Hurter to explain why they did what they did
- Can be used with parents, relatives, siblings, teachers, bullies
- Switch back and forth so each Hurter can explain their behavior

**CRITICAL EXCEPTION:** Where there has been sexual or ongoing physical abuse, DO NOT give the abuser a voice. Enable ONLY the client to speak to the abuser and express what they couldn't say in the past.

#### 3. Upgrading the Child

**Purpose:** Allow clients to take back control and upgrade their younger self who may not have had a voice or felt loved/enough.

**Process:**
- Take the child from each scene
- Install them into the client's current world
- Show them the upgraded life they have now
- Emphasize "Everything is available to you"

**Important:** If you Upgrade the Child, you MUST also Merge the Child.

#### 4. Optional Additional Tools

**Becoming the Loving Parent**
- Used after Upgrading the Child
- Client gives themselves the love they never experienced as a child

**The Praise You've Always Wanted**
- Used after Upgrading the Child
- Client says out loud the words they've always wanted to hear
- Gives themselves the praise they never received

**Note:** Which tools you use depends on what comes up in the scenes. Be guided by your intuition about what the client needs to hear.

#### 5. Merge the Child

**Must be used after Upgrading the Child** - completes that work.

**Process:**
- Client visualizes the child hovering above them
- Child descends and merges into the adult they are now
- The two become fully integrated

#### 6. The Reframe

The last visit to negativity or challenging beliefs before moving to installation.

**Purpose:** Use hypnotic communication and positive, powerful language to condition change.

**Key Points:**
- Use the client's words, phrases, and terminology
- Revisit information from across the session to close those thoughts
- Ensure negative thoughts and beliefs are NOT used in The Transformation recording

**Use strong, commanding language:**
- "This has a constant, continuous, everlasting impact..."
- "It cannot, will not, does not influence you ever again"
- "It is erasing, eradicating, eliminating, removing..."

---

## Stage 4: INSTALL

**Purpose:** Install new, beneficial, and supportive beliefs based on the client's "What You Want" (Magic Wand) and "Life Without the Problem."

### Key Outcomes
- Install and recode new beliefs
- Reinforce the work done in the session
- Direct the subconscious mind toward Life Without the Problem
- Create new habits of thought and action

### Tools Used in Installation

#### 1. The Transformation (Recording)

**Critical Component:** Marisa knows that creating a bespoke audio is crucial to sustain session changes.

**Recording Guidelines:**

**Content:**
- Use the client's words and focus on what they WANT (not what they don't want)
- Use strong, powerful wording
- Weave in highlighted notes from intake form and session
- Include Magic Wand response, Life Without the Problem, and other important elements
- Keep it positive - no negatives

**Technical Specifications:**
- Minimum 15 minutes, maximum 20 minutes
- Use calm and positive tone
- The mind learns by repetition - make it repetitive

**Ending the Recording:**
Add: "You love to play this recording. You play it all the time because it has such a powerful, transforming, wonderful effect on you. You make the time and take the time to listen because its effects are so noticeable. The more you play your recording the better you feel, the better you feel, the more you play it. As my voice goes with you it has the most powerful, permanent and transforming impact on you."

Count client forward from 1 to 5 (except for insomnia recordings - tell them to stay sleeping until wake-up time)

**Listening Protocol:**
- Clients must listen for at least 21 days
- It takes 10-21 days for new behavior patterns to be established
- Embed this instruction into the audio itself

**Recording Methods:**
- Voice memo on mobile phones
- Send via email or text
- Record directly onto client's phone (enable Airplane mode to avoid interruptions, ensure screen doesn't lock)

**Post-Recording:**
- Allow 10 minutes to discuss the session, discoveries, and how they feel
- Congratulate the client for an amazing session

#### 2. Command Cell Therapy (CCT)

**Foundation:** Every cell has its own intelligence; the mind affects body and emotional state.

**Based on:** Bruce Lipton's epigenetics research - our genes and DNA are influenced by thoughts, emotions, diet, and environment.

**Purpose:** Command the client's physical response in their body.

**When to Use:**
- Excessive sweating
- Asthma
- Eczema, dermatitis
- Poor eyesight
- Hearing problems
- Hair growth issues
- Other physical ailments

**Key Principles:**
- The mind reacts to images
- What your mind says yes to, your body says yes to
- What your mind says no to, your body says no to
- There's no drug more powerful than the mind
- The mind can create symptoms and can also remove them
- You can't transform what you don't understand

**CCID:** Command, Compel, Instruct, Direct - back to the original blueprint

**Application:** Can be integrated into the Transformation or used as a standalone technique.

#### 3. Healing Vortex

**Purpose:** An energy force that works through the body to transform physical and emotional pain, rebalancing and realigning both emotional and physical ailments.

**When to Use:** Effective when clients have health issues or emotional problems.

**Process:**
- Client visualizes a vortex of pure light energy like a spinning top
- Vortex enters the body at the head
- Travels through entire body, head to toes, left to right
- Visualize brushes (like a car wash) rotating and dislodging toxic thoughts, beliefs, and substances
- Moves them out of mind and body

**Application:** Can be integrated into the Transformation or used as a standalone technique.

## Developing Your Intuition as an RTT® Professional

As you build competence and confidence, you'll increasingly rely on intuition rather than prescribed steps.

### Being Fully Present

When fully engaged with a client, you'll intuitively know:
- What they need to hear
- Which tool to use
- What to say or do next

### Pay Attention To:
- What the client is representing
- Their Presenting Problem
- What they need

### Remember:
- Intuition is NOT about you or thinking about what you'll do next
- It's about being fully invested in what the client needs
- Trust yourself throughout the session

### The Inner Critic
Your Inner Critic plays a huge role in downplaying intuition. When you replace the Inner Critic with a supportive friend, you become more grounded and invested in the client.

### Development Path
Intuition naturally develops from competence and confidence through practice and experience.
