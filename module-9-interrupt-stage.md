## The 4 I's Roadmap: Interrupt

### Why Is the Interrupt Stage Important?

The tools in the Interrupt stage are used to reframe a client's beliefs by reminding them that they are no longer a dependent child. They have a voice now, they are powerful, and everything is available to them.

### Tools Used in This Stage

- **It's Not Me**
- **Dialogue With The Hurter**
- **Upgrading The Child**
  - Becoming the Loving Parent
  - The Praise You Always Wanted
  - Merge The Child
- **The Reframe**

### What Are You Hoping to Achieve in the Interrupt Stage?

- Assist your client in interrupting their beliefs
- Get them to reframe their beliefs
- Show them that they are no longer a child
- Teach them that they can meet their own needs now

---

## It's Not Me

### Purpose

The purpose of It's Not Me is to:

- Interrupt and reframe a client's beliefs
- Change the meaning they attached to each scene
- Disassociate from the child's experiences and see them from an adult's point of view
- Emphasize why the client no longer needs to identify with the experiences, behaviors, and feelings from their past
- Understand what role these things played in their life because they were age-appropriate at the time

### Key Concept

"We come through our parents, we don't come from them. The universe created you."

This concept helps clients reframe their experiences growing up and, ultimately, empowers them by recognizing their independence and inherent worth.

### Key Steps to It's Not Me

1. **Ask the client to go back to Scene 1**
   - Briefly remind the client what the scene was about

2. **Have them repeat: "It's Not Me because..."**
   - Get the client to say "It's Not Me..." at least 9 times (3 times in each of the 3 scenes)
   - It can be more, but less than 9 times will not be enough
   - Option: Change "It's not me" to "It's not me anymore"

3. **Address their identification with the child**
   - If the client says "I am the child," respond: "Yes, you were that child at [age], and yes, that did happen to you, but that is not you anymore because you are now [age]"

4. **Ask: "Do you need these beliefs anymore?"**

5. **Validate their past feelings while emphasizing present power**
   - Point out that it may have made sense for them to feel what they were feeling or believe what they were believing in that moment (in the scene)
   - Note that any other child would have responded in a similar way
   - Emphasize that now they are an adult with so much more available to them
   - They're able to meet their own needs

6. **Connect past to present**
   - Show them their current life: home, car, possessions, relationships
   - Point out what they know now that they didn't know then

## Upgrading The Child

### Purpose

Upgrading The Child helps clients recognize their power as adults and their ability to meet their own needs now. This tool includes three components that can be used individually or in combination.

### Three Components

#### 1. Merge The Child

**Purpose:** To help the client integrate their younger self with their adult self, recognizing that they have grown and changed.

**When to use:**
- When the client needs to feel complete and whole
- When they need to acknowledge their growth from childhood to adulthood
- When they need to feel compassion for their younger self

**How to facilitate:**
- Guide the client to visualize their younger self
- Have them speak to their younger self with compassion
- Help them bring their younger self into their adult body
- Emphasize that they now have all the resources they didn't have as a child

#### 2. The Praise You've Always Wanted

**Purpose:** To give the client the validation and praise they needed but didn't receive as a child.

**When to use:**
- When the client lacked parental approval or recognition
- When they struggle with self-worth or confidence
- When they need to hear specific words of affirmation they never received

**How to facilitate:**
- Ask the client what they needed to hear as a child
- Identify who they needed to hear it from
- Have them imagine hearing those words now
- Guide them to internalize this praise and make it their own

#### 3. Becoming The Loving Parent

**Purpose:** To help the client become the parent to themselves that they needed but didn't have.

**When to use:**
- When the client had neglectful or absent parents
- When they need to learn to nurture themselves
- When they need to develop self-compassion

**How to facilitate:**
- Guide the client to visualize their younger self
- Have them speak to their younger self as the loving parent they needed
- Encourage them to provide comfort, reassurance, and support
- Help them commit to continuing this self-nurturing relationship

## Dialogue With The Hurter (DWH)

### Purpose

Dialogue With The Hurter gives the client an opportunity to express what they couldn't say as a child. It empowers them to use their voice and take back their power.

### When to Use

- When the client needs to confront someone who hurt them
- When unexpressed anger or pain needs to be released
- When the client needs to set boundaries with someone from their past
- When they need to reclaim their voice and power

### How to Facilitate

1. **Set up the dialogue**
   - Ask the client to imagine the person who hurt them is in front of them
   - Remind them this is their opportunity to say what they couldn't say

2. **Encourage expression**
   - Guide them to express their feelings fully
   - Support them in saying what they needed to say
   - Don't interrupt their flow

3. **Empower them**
   - Remind them they have a voice now
   - They are no longer powerless
   - They can set boundaries and protect themselves

4. **Create closure**
   - Help them say what they need to move forward
   - Guide them to take back their power
   - Support them in letting go

## The Reframe

### Purpose

The Reframe is where the client reviews the challenging beliefs and negative connections they have uncovered during their session for the final time. It's about making sure everything that should be left behind is left in the past, where it belongs.

### Important Notes

- The Reframe always comes just before the Transformation
- **Do not include the Reframe in the recording** you make for the client
- If working in person with the client, carefully place the palm of your hand on their forehead and gently rock their head from side to side
- If working via Zoom, invite the client to move an inch to the left and an inch to the right, creating a gentle swaying, rocking, soothing movement

### What the Reframe Covers

The words you use for the Reframe should include anything the client is leaving behind:
- Thoughts
- Beliefs
- Feelings
- Attitudes
- Limitations
- Blocks
- Memories

### Reframe Scripts

#### Script 1

"As I rock your head, you are letting go... erasing, eradicating, eliminating and releasing every imprint, every impression, every thought, every idea, belief, feeling or memory - anything and indeed everything that ever had you think or believe that ________. It is shrinking, fading, disappearing, going, gone, out of your life, into the past and removed forever.

Every imprint, every impression, every thought, every idea, every belief that had you feeling ________ is shattered, smashed, erased and out of your life. It is all in the past, just like the water in the shower you took this morning. You can't run home tonight and collect that water back, not even if you tried. It's gone.

And even the belief that ________ is shattered, smashed, erased, gone, out of your life. So that, from now on, it will always be something that you used to believe, that cannot, will not, does not ever influence you again."

#### Script 2

"Every imprint, every impression, every thought, idea, belief, feeling or memory, anything and everything that ever told you otherwise - these things are shrinking, fading, disappearing. They are going, they are gone, they are out of your life, they are in your past, they are so far behind. So, just let yourself go deeper. Just let yourself go deeper, deeper and even deeper. As you go deeper, all of those older issues are behind you. They are out of your life, they are shrinking, fading, disappearing. They are going, they are gone.

As I rock your head, every imprint, every impression, every thought, idea, belief, feeling or memory, everything that had you believe ________, everything that had you act, react, think in a way that made you ________, these things are shrinking, fading, disappearing, going, gone. Because when you were a little girl/boy you were dependent, but now you're a grown-up woman/man and you feel safe and loved, and lovable and worthy of love, deserving of love. Anything that told you otherwise is erased, eradicated, shattered, smashed, gone, out of your life, in the past; it is far behind you. It's something you used to have that cannot, will not, does not interest you or affect you ever, ever, ever again. So, knowing that, feeling that, believing that."

### Metaphors for the Reframe

#### The Heavy Coat Metaphor

Imagine you are wearing a heavy winter coat with pockets inside its lining. All the negative beliefs related to this problem are like lumps of metal placed into the lining of this coat. You can feel the weight - it's so heavy. This is what it's like to carry around a problem for such a long time. The Reframe is like taking off the coat, letting it drop to the ground and walking away, never looking back. The coat is gone forever.

#### Garden Weeds Metaphor

Weeds are plants that don't belong. They grow roots that choke the garden. The Reframe involves removing the weeds so that new seeds and plants can be grown in fresh soil. It's a fresh start. The garden can be completely by the client's design now.

#### Removing Old Programs Metaphor

The Reframe is like uninstalling old software on your phone or computer. When you delete an old program, it disappears into the ether. Actively going into the Control Panel and removing all the old programs by pressing 'delete' clears up space for new programs. It allows your system to operate how you want it to run with the programs you choose to install.

### Summary of The Reframe

- The Reframe is where the client reviews challenging beliefs and negative connections for the final time
- It's about making sure everything that should be left behind is left in the past
- The Reframe is what the client is forgetting, leaving behind, and moving away from
- It always comes before the Transformation and is not included in the recording
- It's important to keep any negative thoughts, feelings, or beliefs out of the Transformation (recording)
- The Reframe provides an opportunity to revisit information acquired throughout the session and close down any negative thoughts, feelings, or beliefs
- Make sure you use strong, powerful wording

### The Distinction Between Reframe and Transformation

- **The Reframe:** What the client is leaving behind (the negative)
- **The Transformation:** What the client is moving toward (the positive)

The Reframe clears the old so the Transformation can install the new.
