# Self-Hypnosis Guide

## Introduction to Self-Hypnosis

Self-hypnosis is a powerful tool that you can practice on yourself and teach to clients so they can benefit from using it in any situation. It is a self-directed process that involves taking yourself into hypnosis and giving yourself suggestions.

Self-hypnosis can be used almost anywhere you can find some privacy, as long as you have at least 10 minutes to turn your attention inwards. It is a dialogue with yourself—something you do that very quickly becomes who you are.

## The 5 Steps of Self-Hypnosis

### Step 1: Look Up
- Look up
- Breathe in and out 3 times
- Close your eyes

### Step 2: Drop Your Chin
- Drop your chin
- Imagine looking down 10 steps
- Make your way down each step, saying to yourself: "Step 10, deeper... Step 9, deeper... Step 8, deeper..." (and so on)

### Step 3: Imagine a String on Your Finger
Tell yourself that it is as if someone has tied a string on the little finger of your right hand and it's lifting, tingling, trembling, twitching, and pulling up, all of its own accord.

### Step 4: Give Yourself Suggestions
Once you can see that you're incredibly suggestible, give yourself some great suggestions. For example: "My confidence just increases every day and it makes me so free and so bold and so happy."

### Step 5: Count Back Up
Once you've given yourself suggestions, count from 1 to 5 and open your eyes.

## The 5 Rules of the Mind for Self-Hypnosis

1. **Every thought you think and every word you speak creates a blueprint that your mind and body work to make real.**

2. **Imagination is more powerful than knowledge when dealing with your own mind or the minds of others.**

3. **Your mind learns by repetition.**

4. **When dealing with the subconscious mind, the greater the conscious effort, the less the subconscious responds.**

5. **Your mind does not care if what you tell it is good or bad, it simply lets it in.**

## Giving Yourself Suggestions

When practicing self-hypnosis, you need to give yourself the correct suggestions to reprogram your subconscious mind effectively.

### How to Reprogram Your Mind

#### 1. Speak in the Present Tense

**Don't say:**
- "Next year, when I have a new job, I will be confident."

**Do say:**
- "I have an amazing job."
- "I'm getting an amazing job."
- "I'm acquiring an amazing job because I'm skilled and talented and confident."
- "My confidence is so great that I'm bold."
- "My wonderful confidence and high self-esteem frees me to do so many things I want to do."

#### 2. Use Words That Excite the Imagination

**For example:**
"My confidence thrills me, it relaxes me, it empowers me, it liberates me, it sets me on fire. It gives me the ambition and drive to do all of the things I want to do."

Words like these help your mind create a vivid picture.

#### 3. Avoid Using 'No' and 'Not'

**Don't say:**
- "I'm no longer inadequate. I don't have low self-esteem. I'm not lacking in confidence."
- "I'm no longer scared of getting in the swimming pool."
- "I'm no longer scared of dogs."

**Why?** "I'm not..." doesn't make a picture, but words like "inadequate" and "scared" do create mental images.

### Guidelines for Creating Suggestions

- **The more clear, vivid, and detailed the pictures are that you make in your head, the better.**
- **Give yourself exciting, powerful, and descriptive suggestions.**
- **Incorporate positive emotions.**
- **Think about what you really want and don't limit yourself based on your current beliefs.**

**Examples of powerful suggestions:**
- "I am enough."
- "I am worthy."
- "I am full of confidence and I can achieve whatever I set my mind to."

## Asking Yourself Questions Using Your Fingers (Ideomotor Responses)

When in hypnosis, you can ask your subconscious mind a 'yes' or 'no' question and initiate an involuntary response, usually by moving a part of your body such as your fingers. This is called an Ideomotor Response.

### How to Use Ideomotor Responses

**Step 1:** Rest your hands flat on your lap.

**Step 2:** When in hypnosis, ask your subconscious mind a question that requires a 'Yes' or 'No' answer.

**Step 3:** Say to your subconscious mind, "Lift the 'Yes' or 'No' finger."

**Step 4:** For example: "Should I take that new job? Tell me. Lift the left finger if it's 'No' and the right finger if it's 'Yes'."

**Step 5:** One of your fingers will raise in response to your question.

**Tip:** The right finger is 'right' (or 'yes'). Left is always 'no'.

### Reflection Questions

After your self-hypnosis session, consider:

- What was your experience of imagining seeing, hearing, feeling, and experiencing life the way that you want it to be?
- Is there anything you would add next time you take yourself into self-hypnosis?
