# Module 8: The 4 I's - Interpret

## Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module you will:

- Understand the purpose of LH/RH (Left Hand/Right Hand) and when it is used in the session
- Facilitate LH/RH so that the client can find and state their beliefs
- Understand the purpose of the RFIP tool and the function of the 3 P's
- Know the different uses of RFIP in a session
- Demonstrate effective use of RFIP to enable the client to let go or change the role of the part

## The Interpret Stage

### Why is the Interpret Stage Important?

Interpreting is about helping your clients see how the meaning they attached to events from their past have led to what they feel, think, and believe about themselves today.

When using RFIP, it's about helping your client understand how a physical or emotional issue is showing up in their body. As Marisa says, "If you are unable to speak, your body will speak for you."

### Tools Used in This Stage

- Left Hand/Right Hand (LH/RH)
- RFIP (Role, Function, Purpose, Intention)

### Goals of the Interpret Stage

- Help your client make the connection between scenes from their past and their current issue
- Get your client to realize what conclusions, beliefs, meanings, and interpretations they attached to past events
- Help them review, understand, change, and upgrade limiting beliefs from childhood that are no longer relevant or required as adults
- Find the Role, Function, Purpose, and Intention of the Part

## Left Hand/Right Hand (LH/RH)

> "Scenes do not affect you. The meaning you attach to a scene is what affects you." - Marisa Peer

### Purpose of Left Hand/Right Hand

- To review scenes from the client's past that emerged during Detective Work and link them to their presenting issue today
- To get the client to recognize the meaning they attached to scenes from their past
- LH/RH is the beginning of the client understanding how their interpretation of their past led to their beliefs about themselves today

### Overview

During Left Hand/Right Hand, you review what happened in each scene with the client and together explore the meaning attached to each scene.

LH/RH involves getting the client to look at the three scenes that emerged during Detective Work (Root Cause) and asking them to make a connection to how those scenes still influence and affect them today.

**Remember:** It is the interpretation and meaning of an event that hurts our clients. Your job is to help your client understand the interpretation and meaning they have attached to these events. Don't lead the client or make assumptions - they will make sense of the scenes themselves. Your role is to assist them in doing that.

### Daisy-Chaining

It is important to go to at least 3 scenes in the Detective Work, making a connection across those scenes and back to the presenting issue. The last scene is usually the most significant or emotionally intense. Marisa calls this linking process "Daisy-Chaining."

As Marisa says: "You are daisy-chaining those three scenes together and saying in your mind, 'How did those three scenes lead me to where I am today? How did those three scenes give me issues, or negative beliefs, or limiting beliefs, or some hurt?'"

### Key Steps to Left Hand/Right Hand

1. Ask the client to imagine holding in their **left hand** the three scenes (or more) that emerged during the Detective Work
2. Ask them to imagine a scene of themselves today with their presenting issue in their **right hand**
3. Briefly review what happened in each of the scenes in their left hand
4. Ask the client to make the connection between the scenes in their left hand and the scene of themselves today in their right hand
5. Encourage the client to work out the meaning/interpretation they attached to the events in their left hand and how that has led to the issue they have today
6. Make sure the client sees how the meaning/interpretation they attached to the scenes from their past is no longer relevant today
7. Ask the client if they still need these beliefs

### Making the Connection

Here are three examples Marisa uses to help clients make the connection during Left Hand/Right Hand:

**1. The Essay Prompt**
"Imagine you've got to write an essay and the essay is, 'How Did Those Scenes in Childhood Lead Me Today to This Feeling That I __________?'"

**2. The Google Search**
"Imagine you're going to type it out: 'Hey Google, why did those 3 scenes in my childhood leave me believing __________?' Hit 'Search' - it's come up on the screen."

**3. The Tape**
"Imagine there is a piece of tape running between the left and right hand. On the tape, you can see words telling you the connection between these scenes and your issue today. What words can you see?"

## RFIP (Role, Function, Purpose, Intention)

### What is RFIP?

RFIP is a powerful tool that allows clients to give voice to a physical or emotional issue/symptom, or a part of themselves. By asking the part what its Role, Function, Purpose, and Intention is, the client can understand why the issue exists and what it is trying to do for them.

Marisa says you should do RFIP in almost every session. RFIP can be thought of as an extension of Detective Work, or a different form of Detective Work. RFIP does not require the client to 'see' anything.

### Purpose of RFIP

- To understand why a physical or emotional issue has come into the client's life
- To understand what the issue is trying to do for the client
- To discover where/when it started
- To show the client that if they have the power to create a problem/issue, they have the power to transform it
- To demonstrate how the body can react to unexpressed or suppressed feelings

### The 3 P's Framework

The 3 P's help you understand the deeper purpose of a part:

1. **Punisher** - The part punishes the client
2. **Protector** - The part protects the client
3. **Perpetuator** - The part perpetuates patterns from the past

Understanding which category a part falls into helps guide how you work with it.

### The RFIP Questions

Asking for the Role, the Function, the Purpose, and the Intention of a part is a way of asking the same (or similar) type of question in 4 different ways. This allows the client to dig deeper and truly discover what a part has been trying to do for them all these years.

**If the client gets confused:** Just change RFIP to 'Job'. "I'm the (physical/emotional issue) and I have a job, and my job is to..."

### When to Use RFIP

- When the client has a physical symptom or issue
- When the client has an emotional issue that feels like it has a "life of its own"
- When Detective Work doesn't yield clear scenes
- For clients who struggle with 'seeing' scenes
- When something isn't quite as straightforward as you think
- When dealing with a medical problem

### RFIP Script

**Ask the client:**
"I want you to speak as if you are the (issue/symptom/part). I'm the __________ and my role is to..."

Then continue with:
- "My function is to..."
- "My purpose is to..."
- "My intention is to..."

**Follow-up questions:**
- "When did you start doing this?"
- "How old was (client's name) when you came into their life?"
- "What happens if you stop doing this?"
- "What are you afraid will happen if you leave?"

### Three Options for Working with the Part

#### Option 1: Thank and Dismiss the Part

If the part's role is no longer needed:

**Say to the client:**
- "Thank you for (state what the part has been doing)"
- "But I don't need you anymore"
- "I am no longer (number) years old"
- "I'm an adult now"
- "I am __________" (insert empowering, positive words)
- "After all of these years, you can stop"
- "You can go now"

**Ask the client:**
- "Is the part gone?"

**If they respond "No," ask:**
- "How long will it take for the part to go?"
- "What will it take to make the part leave?"
- "How will you know when the part is gone after (number) hours/days?"

#### Option 2: Give the Part a New Job (A New Role)

If the part isn't ready to leave:

**Say to your client:**
"This part has been playing a role for you for a long time but that role no longer serves you anymore."

**Ask:**
"If you could give this part a new role, a new function, a new purpose and intention, a job that helps you and supports you in the most beneficial way, what would that be?"

**Examples:** Reframe the old RFIP of the part so that it becomes positive, supportive, and nurturing. If the part's RFIP was to punish the client, suggest the part can become a coach, a cheerleader, a best friend, or a praiser.

Once the part has been assigned a new RFIP, ask your client to imagine integrating this part back into themselves with this new role/job.

#### Option 3: Working with Secondary Gain

**What is Secondary Gain?**
A secondary gain is when there is a hidden benefit that the client may be getting from keeping a physical/emotional issue/symptom.

**Example:** A part may be keeping the client safe by giving them headaches which prevent the client from entering challenging social situations where they might be rejected. The part has concluded that if it does not cause headaches, then the client will be rejected (not safe).

**How to Work with Secondary Gain:**

**Say to the client:**
"This part has been playing a role for you for a long time to __________ (state the secondary gain, e.g., keep you safe), but that role needs to change in order to give you what you need today and to help you in a way that benefits you."

"So let's give this part a new way of supporting you, something that will serve you and help you in your life today, while still __________ (state the secondary gain, e.g., keeping you safe)."

**Ask:**
"What can this part do for you that will continue to keep you safe and give you what you want today? What role do you want to give it?"

Allow the client to come up with a new role that benefits them while still fulfilling the secondary gain in a more resourceful manner.

### RFIP for Clients Who Struggle with Scenes

For clients who may struggle with 'seeing' scenes, RFIP can be used to reach, clarify, or confirm scenes. It offers a way for the client to uncover information by tapping into their feelings and giving voice to formerly repressed emotions.
