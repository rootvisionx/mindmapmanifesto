## The 4 I's Roadmap: Install

### Why is the Install Stage Important?

The final stage of an RTT® session is to install new, beneficial and supportive beliefs based on each client's Magic Wand and Life Without the Problem. You can include any additional keywords you collect during the Intake and throughout the session.

### Tools Used in This Stage

- The Transformation
- Command Cell Therapy
- Healing Vortex

### What Are You Hoping to Achieve in the Install Stage?

- To install and recode new beliefs
- To reinforce the work done in session
- To direct your client's subconscious mind towards their life without the problem
- To create a new habit of thought, and as a result, new habit of action

### The Power of Subconscious Change

Perhaps you know someone whose behavior shifted when they fell in love. In such examples, a person's behavior changed quickly because what they thought, believed and felt changed subconsciously, based on the intensity of the situation and the shift in their perception.

By working with both the conscious and subconscious mind, you are helping the client to optimize the time it takes for them to change their life and the depth of change they experience.

> **Marisa says:** "When you're changing a person's habit of action, without changing the habit of thought, it's going to keep coming back....you've got to take away the fixed habit of thought before you can take away the fixed habit of action."

## The Three Ways We Change

Marisa says that there are three ways we change:

### 1. Immediate Change

This is what we all want - a client who says, "Oh my god, I'm so different. I left your office and straight away I felt different. I couldn't even look at a cake. I noticed myself smiling. I spoke to strangers on the train. Something's changed."

### 2. Cumulative Change

This is where the client is noticing little things. For example, "I went into the garage to buy chocolate and I came out with some grapes" or, "I was very nervous about meeting my boss but, actually, when I met him I was fine. I looked him in the eye and I spoke" or, "I notice little things. I'm nicer with my kids; I'm not shouting."

### 3. Retroactive Change

This is where people do not even know they have changed until they look back. For example, "Before, you were always looking for dogs and now that you're not afraid of dogs, they're not even registering."

When you are scared of spiders, you look for them. When you are scared of animals, you look for them. When you are scared of being mugged, you walk home constantly looking over your shoulder, with your bag tucked under your arm and your keys gripped between your fingers in case someone attacks you.

Many people have no idea they have changed until someone says, "Oh my god, you're so different. What's happened to you? Look at how you're holding yourself" or, "Gosh, when you gave that team meeting this week, you were so eloquent. I've never seen you like that before." The client says, "Oh, I didn't know I'd changed but my kids have told me, my boss has told me, my workmates told me."

## The Transformation

> "Every habit of action is run by a habit of thought" - Marisa Peer

### Purpose of The Transformation

- To provide positive suggestions that highlight what a client wants and their life without the problem, installing a client's new beliefs
- To create a bespoke audio that a client listens to for 21 days

### The Transformation Overview

- The Transformation is where you install good beliefs through positive suggestions
- It can include Command Cell Therapy and/or Healing Vortex
- You will always create a bespoke Transformation

### Key Steps to The Transformation

> "Understanding is power and understanding in hypnosis is the most phenomenal, extraordinary, liberating power."

1. Get the client to look around, through and behind the scenes, and realize how they came to the conclusions they did
2. Get the client to see that because they had the power to create the beliefs they did, they can transform them now in no time at all
3. Give the client positive suggestions based on the information they provided during the Intake and what came up during the session
4. Tell the client that they love listening to their recording every day
5. Bring the client back to full awareness

## Flipping Negative Trigger Words

When you ask clients what it is they do want, they will often tell you what they don't want. For example, "I don't want to feel anxious," or "I wish I didn't feel so held back all the time."

In both examples, the client is still focused on the negative rather than the positive (what they want).

### Examples of Flipping Negative Phrases

**Negative:** "I don't want to feel anxious when I speak in front of people."  
**Positive:** "You remain completely calm, totally relaxed, and absolutely at ease whenever you speak in front of people."

**Negative:** "I'm unable to take action towards my goals."  
**Positive:** "Your powerful subconscious mind motivates you, conditions you, it programs you, it absolutely compels you to take action towards your goals."

**Negative:** "I can't stop eating sweets."  
**Positive:** "You find it so easy to make healthy choices. Your mind and body work together perfectly to choose foods that nourish you and make you feel amazing."

## Command Cell Therapy (CCT)

### Purpose of Command Cell Therapy

- To activate the client's body to heal itself

## Healing Vortex (HV)

### Combining CCT and HV

## Installing the Cheerleader

### Purpose of Installing The Cheerleader

- To raise the client's self-esteem
- To get the client's mind to act as their very own cheerleader/coach
- To replace negative thoughts with positive self-belief

Installing The Cheerleader is an add-on technique that can be used in RFIP if the part does not want to leave. If this is the case, you can assign the part a new role as a cheerleader. It can also be used in the transformation to empower the client to praise themselves, and be supportive of themselves, rather than criticize.

### Key Concepts

- Every baby that comes onto the planet is born with a cheerleader that spurs them on
- For many people, the cheerleader goes away and in comes an inner critic
- When you praise yourself, your self-esteem goes up and when you criticize yourself, your self-esteem goes down
- When you praise yourself, there is no agenda; it must be true
- Whatever you tell your mind, it believes to be true

### Key Steps to Installing the Cheerleader

1. Tell the client, "We're going to install the cheerleader"
2. Explain to the client that a cheerleader's job is to root for you
3. Ask the client, "If you had a cheerleader working for you, what would they say?"
4. Ask, "What else would they say? What else?" (Ask this question until the client says, "That's it")
5. Get the client to imagine installing a cheerleader, waving their pom-poms and repeating the phrases they gave you

### Questions for Gathering Information

- What would your best friend say about you?
- Imagine you had an amazing loving grandmother or wise woman what would she say about you?
- What would the most incredible teacher say about you?
- What would the best lover say about you?
- What would the most supportive partner say about you?
- What would the most amazing boss say about you?
- What would a loving auntie say about you?
- What about a loving brother or sister?

### Summary

- Installing the Cheerleader is used to build the client's self-esteem and work on the areas of praise they never had
- A cheerleader's job is to root for you
- This technique helps replace the inner critic with a supportive inner voice
