## The Common Denominator: Limiting Beliefs

### What Are Limiting Beliefs?

Our limiting beliefs are some of the biggest mental blocks holding us back. Many of us dream big, but there is always an inner voice telling us we are not good enough or that we are undeserving. These doubts are known as limiting beliefs, and they prevent us from living happy, fulfilling lives.

To achieve personal success and happiness, you must first break these limiting beliefs and change your story. Once you clear them from your mind, you will automatically develop the courage and confidence to pursue your dreams and rewrite your life.

**Simply put, a limiting belief is a state of mind, a conviction, or anything you perceive as real, which also limits your life.** It is a generalization about yourself and/or how the world works - even if there is little or no evidence to support it.

### Examples of Limiting Beliefs

Have you ever thought that you are unable to lose weight because of your genetics? Or maybe you believe that you have so much debt that you will never be able to repay it, and so you decide to spend your money on other things instead. If you have ever had a thought like, "I can never do A because of B", you are likely to be holding a limiting belief.

### How Limiting Beliefs Affect You

Limiting beliefs make you:

- Focus on the negative parts of your life
- Blind to opportunities that come your way
- Crippled by low self-confidence and low self-worth
- Feel held back from making positive choices

The worst part about limiting beliefs is that most of these beliefs operate at a subconscious level, so many of us do not even realize we have them. This is why it is essential to know where limiting beliefs come from and why they are so powerful.

## Where Do Limiting Beliefs Come From?

We have deeply held beliefs that drive our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and we quite often don't understand where they've come from. This can be broken down into two main categories of influences:

1. **Your interpretation of what's happening around you in the wider environment**
2. **How you interact with others**

### Your Childhood

From the time we are born until the age of five, our brains develop faster than at any other period of our lives. During this period of rapid brain development, children are constantly absorbing information. Sometimes this information can develop into a limiting belief.

As children, we simply accept something as true because our brains are still developing, and we do not yet have a complete understanding of how the world works.

**Examples:**

- If your parents were always yelling at each other, your subconscious mind may have thought that getting angry and raising your voice are natural ways of resolving conflict.
- If your parents were always saying things like "we are poor", you might suffer from a lower sense of self-worth. You may even associate other peoples' values with how much money they make.

These beliefs can stay with you into adulthood, preventing you from developing healthy relationships with yourself and other people.

### Your Past Experiences and Trauma

Another source of limiting beliefs comes from our own experiences and personal traumas.

**Example:** Have you ever found it difficult to trust someone new after being hurt by an ex-partner or spouse? If you answered yes, then you have experienced a limiting belief which stems from personal trauma. If left unchecked, that belief could stop you from developing deep and meaningful relationships with future partners.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an extreme form of trauma - it has been linked with higher activity in the areas of the brain that processes fear, and less activation in the prefrontal cortex (the area of the brain that acts towards your goals).

In other words, a traumatic experience makes it easier for your brain to develop beliefs based on emotion rather than facts.

### Your Culture and Community

We are all influenced in some way by our culture and community. Things like religion, family, and education affect our values and the way we see the world.

However, some of these values can directly oppose our own values and limit us from living an authentic life.

**Example:** If someone told you that being a lawyer means you are more successful than if you were a musician and, as a result, you decide not to pursue a career in music.

It is natural to have a set of values derived from your culture and community. However, if these values stop you from living your life authentically, that is a limitation.

As you can see, limiting beliefs come from the places that are most personal to us, which is why they are powerful. The good news is that you can empower yourself to overcome limiting beliefs. To do this, you must first identify what your limiting beliefs are.
