## The Common Denominator: Limiting Beliefs

### What Are Limiting Beliefs?

Our limiting beliefs are some of the biggest mental blocks holding us back. Many of us dream big, but there is always an inner voice telling us we are not good enough or that we are undeserving. These doubts are known as limiting beliefs, and they prevent us from living happy, fulfilling lives.

To achieve personal success and happiness, you must first break these limiting beliefs and change your story. Once you clear them from your mind, you will automatically develop the courage and confidence to pursue your dreams and rewrite your life.

**Simply put, a limiting belief is a state of mind, a conviction, or anything you perceive as real, which also limits your life.** It is a generalization about yourself and/or how the world works - even if there is little or no evidence to support it.

### Examples of Limiting Beliefs

Have you ever thought that you are unable to lose weight because of your genetics? Or maybe you believe that you have so much debt that you will never be able to repay it, and so you decide to spend your money on other things instead. If you have ever had a thought like, "I can never do A because of B", you are likely to be holding a limiting belief.

### How Limiting Beliefs Affect You

Limiting beliefs make you:

- Focus on the negative parts of your life
- Blind to opportunities that come your way
- Crippled by low self-confidence and low self-worth
- Feel held back from making positive choices

The worst part about limiting beliefs is that most of these beliefs operate at a subconscious level, so many of us do not even realize we have them. This is why it is essential to know where limiting beliefs come from and why they are so powerful.

## Where Do Limiting Beliefs Come From?

We have deeply held beliefs that drive our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and we quite often don't understand where they've come from. This can be broken down into two main categories of influences:

1. **Your interpretation of what's happening around you in the wider environment**
2. **How you interact with others**

### Your Childhood

From the time we are born until the age of five, our brains develop faster than at any other period of our lives. During this period of rapid brain development, children are constantly absorbing information. Sometimes this information can develop into a limiting belief.

As children, we simply accept something as true because our brains are still developing, and we do not yet have a complete understanding of how the world works.

**Examples:**

- If your parents were always yelling at each other, your subconscious mind may have thought that getting angry and raising your voice are natural ways of resolving conflict.
- If your parents were always saying things like "we are poor", you might suffer from a lower sense of self-worth. You may even associate other peoples' values with how much money they make.

These beliefs can stay with you into adulthood, preventing you from developing healthy relationships with yourself and other people.

### Your Past Experiences and Trauma

Another source of limiting beliefs comes from our own experiences and personal traumas.

**Example:** Have you ever found it difficult to trust someone new after being hurt by an ex-partner or spouse? If you answered yes, then you have experienced a limiting belief which stems from personal trauma. If left unchecked, that belief could stop you from developing deep and meaningful relationships with future partners.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an extreme form of trauma - it has been linked with higher activity in the areas of the brain that processes fear, and less activation in the prefrontal cortex (the area of the brain that acts towards your goals).

In other words, a traumatic experience makes it easier for your brain to develop beliefs based on emotion rather than facts.

### Your Culture and Community

We are all influenced in some way by our culture and community. Things like religion, family, and education affect our values and the way we see the world.

However, some of these values can directly oppose our own values and limit us from living an authentic life.

**Example:** If someone told you that being a lawyer means you are more successful than if you were a musician and, as a result, you decide not to pursue a career in music.

It is natural to have a set of values derived from your culture and community. However, if these values stop you from living your life authentically, that is a limitation.

As you can see, limiting beliefs come from the places that are most personal to us, which is why they are powerful. The good news is that you can empower yourself to overcome limiting beliefs. To do this, you must first identify what your limiting beliefs are.

## Working with Common Issues

### Working with Confidence and Self-Esteem

Confidence issues usually stem from a childhood belief that you are "not enough," not smart enough, or not interesting enough. This core wound drives many adult behaviors and limitations.

**Key Approaches:**

- Identify where the "Not Enough" belief started (The Origin Scene).
- Use the **Cheerleader technique** to replace the inner critic with a supportive internal voice.
- **The Core Installation**: "I have always been enough, and I will always be enough." This is considered the most powerful phrase in RTT®.

### Transforming Phobias

A phobia is never random; it is your mind trying to protect you from something it perceives as a threat, often based on a misunderstood past event.

**RFIP Strategy for Phobias:**

1. **Role**: "To keep me safe/alive."
2. **Function**: "To stop me going near [the trigger: e.g., spiders, heights]."
3. **Purpose**: "To prevent me from feeling that debilitating fear again."
4. **Intention**: To ensure survival at all costs.

**The Solution**: Show the mind that the threat is old, and the protective mechanism is no longer relevant to your current life.

### Working with Money Blocks

Money blocks are rarely about the currency itself. They are usually projections of **worth** or **safety**.

**Common Hidden Beliefs:**

- "Rich people are inherently bad or greedy."
- "If I have money, people will only use me or like me for my wealth."
- "I don't deserve to have more than my parents had."

**Reframing**:
Shift the view of money to "energy." It is a tool for good. "The more I have, the more I can give and the more impact I can make."

### Working with Weight Loss

Diets often fail because they address the biological body without addressing the psychological role of the weight.

**The Emotional Roles of Weight:**

- **Protection**: Acts as emotional "armor" against the world.
- **Insulation**: A way to keep people at a distance.
- **Reward**: Food becomes the primary source of comfort or "the only friend."

**Key Diagnostic Question**: "What does this weight do *for* you?"
**The Cognitive Shift**: Move from the restriction of "I can't eat that" to the empowerment of "I choose to nourish my body."

#### Activity: Working with Weight Loss

Reflect on the following:

- What is the main reason that most diets fail according to the principles above?
- How can you apply the "Role, Function, Intention, Purpose" framework to a client's relationship with food?

### Working with Relationship Issues

We attract what we believe we deserve. If the subconscious believes "Love is painful" or "Everyone eventually leaves," it will seek partners to prove that hypothesis correct.

**The Resolution**:
You must first cultivate a relationship with yourself. You cannot give what you do not have within.

- **Essential Installations**: "I am lovable," "I am worthy of deep connection."

### Working with Health Issues

The mind and body are an integrated loop. Physical pain often carries a message from the subconscious.

**The Language of Pain**:

- Pain often means: "Stop!", "Review your life!", or "Notice what you are ignoring!"
- **Illness as a Solution**: Sometimes illness solves a deeper conflict, such as providing a "valid" reason to avoid a high-stress environment or to receive care.

**The Ownership Rule**: Never refer to a condition as "my" (e.g., "my migraine"). Refer to it as "the migraine" to avoid identifying with the illness.

#### Activity: Working with Health Issues

Reflect on the following questions:

1. What has pain stopped you from doing that you might have wanted to avoid anyway?
2. How has a health issue "prioritized" you in the eyes of others or yourself?
3. Why is it critical that clients never take ownership of a diagnosis?
4. How can RFIP be applied to understand the message behind a chronic symptom?

## Advanced: Dimensional Manifestation

To truly resolve common issues, we must understand the mechanics of how reality is formed and accepted.

### The Manifestation Triad

Manifestation is the product of three aligned vectors: **Desire × Belief × Acceptance**.

1. **Desire (Heart)**: A clear, specific heart-centered wanting.
2. **Belief (Mind)**: The genuine conviction that the outcome is possible.
3. **Acceptance (Will)**: The willingness to receive. This is where most blocks occur.

**Diagnostic States:**

- **The Stranglehold**: High Desire + Low Acceptance. You repel your goal by grasping too tightly.
- **Fantasy Mode**: High Desire + Low Belief. Daydreaming without the conviction required for form.

### The Reverse Equation

Most people operate on a "Struggle Model": **HAVE → DO → BE** ("If I have money, I can do things, then I'll be happy").

The "Nazar Model" reverses this: **BE → DO → HAVE**.

- **BE**: Step into the state first (Abundance, Health, Peace).
- **DO**: Actions flow naturally from that state.
- **HAVE**: The physical results manifest as a consequence of who you are being.
