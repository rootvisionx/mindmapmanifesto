## The 3 Foundational Rules of the Mind

### 1. Your mind does what it thinks you want it to do

The words you use create your reality. Your mind takes your language literally and works to make it real.

**Activity:** Create a two-column list:

- Column 1: Dramatic, descriptive, negative words you currently use (e.g., nightmare, disaster, terrible)
- Column 2: Replacement words that don't cause a negative physical reaction (e.g., challenging, difficult, manageable)

### 2. Your mind only responds to two things: the pictures you make in your head and the words you say to yourself

Your internal imagery and self-talk directly influence your reality. What you visualize and verbalize becomes your experience.

### 3. Your mind loves what is familiar and hates what is unfamiliar

#### Activity - Make the Unfamiliar Familiar

Create a two-column list:

- Column 1: Your negative habits (e.g., overeating, procrastinating, dating the wrong type of person)
- Column 2: Currently unfamiliar behaviors you would like to make familiar (e.g., choosing healthy food, taking action immediately)

## The Complete Rules of the Mind

1. **Every thought you think and every word you say form a blueprint** that your mind, body and psyche work to make real
2. **The strongest force in every human being** is that you must act in a way that is absolutely consistent with your thinking
3. **Every thought you think has a physical reaction and an emotional response**
4. **Imagination is more powerful than logic**
5. **Your mind learns by repetition**
6. **What you expect almost always tends to be realized**
7. **Your mind does not care if what you tell it is true or false** - it lets it in
8. **You make your beliefs and then your beliefs turn right around and make you**
9. **Your mind loves what is familiar and hates what is unfamiliar**
10. **Your mind only responds to two things:** the pictures you make in your head and the words you say to yourself
11. **The way you feel about anything is down to the words you use**
12. **The mind cannot hold conflicting beliefs**
13. **Your mind does what it thinks you want it to do**

## Unmet Needs and Childhood

When adults do not meet a child's fundamental needs, the child cannot blame the adult—they blame themselves instead. A child can never meet their own needs.

### A Child's Fundamental Needs

- "I need to feel significant"
- "I need to feel loved"
- "I need to feel I matter"
- "I need to feel celebrated"
- "I need to feel my parents are proud of me"

### When Needs Are Not Met, Two Things Can Happen

1. You believe your needs will never be met, so you give up on them
2. You give your needs away—you find someone else in an attempt to fulfill them

### The Impact on Adult Life

These childhood feelings can last a lifetime:

- Because I do not feel safe, I cannot take risks
- Because I feel unlovable, I hold myself back
- Because I feel unworthy, I do not aim high

**The good news:** RTT® helps clients recognize they are no longer dependent children and can meet their own needs now.

## The 3 Beliefs

All limiting beliefs tend to fall under one of these three core beliefs:

### Belief 1: "I'm Not Enough"

This manifests as:

- I'm not lovable enough
- I'm not smart enough
- I'm not interesting enough
- I'm not attractive enough
- I'm not rich enough

**The Reality:** You were born enough. Babies know this is true. It is only when we start to grow up that we forget this inherent truth. You can reclaim your enoughness by knowing it, feeling it, and believing it again.

**Key Insight:** Not feeling good enough is one of the biggest issues affecting humanity. When someone believes they are not enough, they tend to crave external things to fill the emptiness inside—more attention, more money, more food, more drugs, more sex, or more material things. But it never seems to be enough.

The only person that can love you completely and unconditionally is you.

### Belief 2: "It's Not Available to Me"

This manifests as:

- I want love, but it's not available
- I want to be healthy, but I come from a family of asthmatics
- I want to be happy, but everyone in my family has the 'depression' gene
- I want to stop drinking, but my job is too stressful

**Origins:** This belief is often passed down from adults to children. "We learn what we live, and we live what we learn." It can also come from the experience of not having many choices in childhood.

**How It Presents:** People with this belief may:

- Pay more attention to criticism
- Find it challenging to accept or give themselves praise
- Brush off compliments and rationalize why they cannot be true
- Example: After being told "You did a fantastic job," they say "Oh, I was just lucky. Anyone could have done that."

**The Antidote:** Start to praise yourself often because self-praise is always available to you.

### Belief 3: "I'm Different"

This manifests as:

- I'm not like you
- I don't fit in
- I'm the only poor kid at school
- I'm the only one at work with no qualifications

**The Reality:** Being different is a fear of rejection. We survive by finding connection and avoiding rejection. At a primordial level, our biggest fear is that we will die if we are rejected—because for our ancestors, being rejected meant being exiled by our tribe.

**Key Insight:** We have all felt different at some point in our lives, which is what makes us all the same. The antidote to this belief is to recognize that most people fear being different, which makes you the same as everyone else.

## The 4 Roles

When children begin to notice or feel that they are not significant just the way they are, they are forced to take on one of four roles to gain attention and feel significant:

1. **The Overachiever**
2. **The People Pleaser**
3. **The Rebel/Troublemaker**
4. **The Invisible/Withdrawn One**

These roles are adopted in childhood as survival strategies and often continue into adulthood.

## Thoughts, Feelings, Actions, and Events

**The Chain Reaction:**
> Your thoughts control your feelings, your feelings control your actions, and your actions control your events.

### Case Study: Fear of Public Speaking

Jada, 40, experiences overwhelming fear of speaking in front of groups.

**Childhood Event:** At 7 years old, she was humiliated by her teacher while standing in front of her class.

**The Pattern:**

- **Thought:** Public speaking = rejection
- **Feeling:** Terror, fear of mind going blank
- **Action:** Avoidance, anxiety, trembling
- **Event:** Unable to give presentations despite knowing the material well

**The Imprint:** Her subconscious mind is trying to protect her from the rejection she experienced in the past. These feelings became linked to public speaking, creating an association that carried into adulthood.

> "If you want to control any behavior at all, start by changing the belief." — Marisa Peer

**Solution:** Through RTT®, you can break the client's old wiring and help them create new associations that will help them move toward the future they desire.

## Pain Versus Pleasure: The Key Drivers of Human Behavior

> Your mind has one job: to keep you alive on the planet for as long as it can. It does this by moving you away from pain and toward pleasure.

### The Pain-Pleasure Principle

Originally developed by Sigmund Freud, this principle suggests that we make all choices and decisions based on:

- Avoiding or reducing what causes us pain
- Gravitating toward what brings us pleasure

**Critical Point:** The mind is significantly more motivated to avoid pain than to seek pleasure because avoiding pain is how we stay alive. Avoiding immediate pain is a much stronger motivator than seeking immediate pleasure.

### Types of Pain

- **Physical:** Being hurt, injured, or sick
- **Emotional:** Not being accepted (rejection, judgment, failure, disappointing others)

**The Tribal Connection:** If we are not accepted, we are not part of the 'tribe.' In times gone by, if you were kicked out of the tribe, you would not survive.

Pain versus pleasure is at the heart of who we are—it influences our perceptions, beliefs, values, actions, behavior, decisions, and everything we do every day.

## The 5 Stress Responses

You may be familiar with Fight/Flight/Freeze—our body's natural response to danger, triggered by fear. However, there are actually five responses:

### 1. Fight

Responding with aggression as a form of protection.

**Manifests in adulthood as:**

- The need to be in control
- Expecting perfection from others
- Unpredictable temper, bursts of anger
- Not acting fairly toward others
- Abusing power to feel secure
- Being inconsiderate of others' perspectives

### 2. Flight

The desire to run away or flee a situation.

**Manifests in adulthood as:**

- Worrying, inability to relax
- Needing everything to be perfect
- Working too much, needing to keep busy
- Becoming obsessive or compulsive
- Anxiety and panic

### 3. Freeze

Attempting to hide or dissociate from pain.

**Manifests in adulthood as:**

- Difficulty making decisions
- Desire for solitude and self-isolation
- Dissociation, brain fog, feeling unreal
- Hiding away
- Lack of motivation or achievement in life

### 4. Flop

Total collapse, loss of consciousness, blacking out, and complete disorientation—a loss of control over the whole body. The muscles literally 'flop' and give way, causing immobility.

### 5. Fawn

An unconscious attempt to appease or make peace with an aggressor, often occurring in cases involving abuse, sexual trauma, torture, or being held hostage.

**Manifests in adulthood as:**

- People-pleasing
- Self-censoring
- Fear of saying 'No'
- Putting others' needs and desires first
- No boundaries in relationships
- Codependency
- Caring too much about what others think
- Striving to be accepted
- Not standing up for oneself

### Working with Trauma

When a client has experienced trauma, their nervous system can get stuck in a high-alert state of hypervigilance. The client may habitually overreact in situations that would otherwise be considered safe.

**Important:** PTSD is a very complex issue. When working with clients who present problems caused by PTSD, always work within your scope of practice.

## Looping Thoughts

Every thought we have creates a physical reaction and an emotional response. Emotions dictate our actions and behavior, which, in turn, provoke thoughts. This pattern (thoughts-feelings-actions-thoughts) makes up the repetitive pattern of **Looping Thoughts**.

### Example of a Looping Thought Pattern

"I can't do anything right." → "This makes me feel anxious." → "I can't do anything because I'm stupid." → "I'm stupid because I can't do anything right." → And so on...

**Impact:** Looping thoughts can lead to stress, anxiety, depression, and general unhappiness.

### Why Looping Thoughts Are Difficult to Escape

1. **Repetition Creates Blueprint:** The more the client repeats the looping pattern, the more it becomes hardwired in their thinking. They believe their thoughts are a part of them and cannot be changed.

2. **Familiarity:** The client finds it difficult to stop the pattern because they have repeated it so often that it is now familiar to their mind.

3. **Emotion Wins:** The client's emotions overrule their ability to think themselves out of the looping pattern.

### Real-Life Transformation Example

**Before:**

- "I can't, I shouldn't, I should. Something is wrong with me."
- Starting something, then regretting it three days later
- Constant comparison, always falling short
- Making others wrong to justify being victimized
- Non-stop people pleasing
- So much fear

**After (Through RTT®):**

- "Today I am a confident, radiant man with ease and inner joy at my core"
- "I am in a state of bliss most of the time, with tools to assist me when I'm not"
- "I laugh more than ever and sleep peacefully at night"
- "I feel loved and lovable"

## The Ladder of Looping Thoughts

This exercise demonstrates that clients can choose their thoughts and that by choosing better thoughts, they can change how they feel and behave.

### Exercise Steps

1. **Identify the Area:** Which areas of your life do you wish were different? What is holding you back?
   - Example: "I wish I had the confidence to apply for that job"

2. **Underlying Thought:** What is the underlying thought?
   - Example: "I don't have confidence because I feel I'm not enough"

3. **Feeling:** How does this make you feel?
   - Example: "I feel sad and disappointed in myself"

4. **Action:** How does this make you act?
   - Example: "I procrastinate with job applications, or I just keep putting off applying"

5. **Flip It:** Create a new ladder using the positive thought
   - Example: "I am enough"
   - New feeling: Confident, hopeful
   - New action: Actively applying for jobs

## Strategies for Working with Looping Thoughts

### Key Techniques

1. **Use Reframing:** Turn negative thoughts into positive thoughts
   - Negative: "I can't do this presentation; I'm terrible at public speaking"
   - Positive: "I'm nervous about public speaking, but I'll give this presentation my best shot!"

2. **Active Listening:** Listen carefully to the client's words when they describe their thoughts and feelings

3. **Identify Language Patterns:** Use words that align with their verbal communication styles to build rapport

### Key Points for Clients to Understand

- **They were not born with these thoughts.** The thoughts were created from life experiences
- **The thoughts feel permanent** because they've been repeating them so often they are now hardwired in the brain
- **They can change the pattern** by deconstructing it and replacing each thought, feeling, and action with ones they would prefer

## Key Principles Summary

### Tell Your Mind Better Things

Because your mind believes everything you tell it, tell it **better things**.

### How the Mind Makes Us Survive

The mind makes us survive by **remembering what hurt us** so we can avoid similar pain in the future.

### Words to Use When Telling Your Mind What You Want

Use words that are:

- **Vital** - Important and life-giving
- **Relevant** - Connected to your actual goals
- **Exciting** - Energizing and motivating
- **Vivid** - Clear and detailed, creating strong mental images

Avoid words that are:

- Calming (when you need energy)
- Aggressive (creates resistance)
- Generic (lacks power)
