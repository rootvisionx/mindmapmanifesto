## The History of Hypnosis

### What is Hypnosis?

Many people describe hypnosis as a process through which communication between the conscious and subconscious minds can take place. The process involves a person's subconscious mind becoming more dominant and their conscious mind less dominant.

For many people, hypnosis can feel relaxing, although relaxation is not a requirement. The word 'relax' is usually suggested to the client several times during an induction, which is what causes the client to feel this way.

**Hypnosis is all about facilitating a state of inward focus.**

Hypnosis has very little to do with pendulums or swinging watches, as has been popularly depicted. The swinging watch is an example of how to capture the subject's focus, fascination and attention. These are all necessary ingredients when taking a client into an inward-focused state, but no watches or pendulums are required.

Some authors claim that hypnosis is not therapy in and of itself but a process of guiding a subject in and out of a trance-like state. This typically involves guiding the subject to turn their attention inwards using their imagination or assisting them to revivify memories. In hypnosis, the subject will naturally become less concerned with any external input governed by their five senses.

### Historical Context

The history of hypnosis extends back many centuries and into ancient times. Ritual, prayer, myth, witch doctors, saints and healing temples are all examples of how hypnosis has taken many forms over the years, although the underlying principles remain the same.

Today, viewing advertising, reading a good book, watching a great movie, and being in deep conversation with a friend are all forms of trance that people go into every day. This is why many people find these activities meaningful or even therapeutic on some level: the subconscious mind becomes engaged, which permits the conscious mind to relax.

### Trance Versus Hypnosis

The words 'trance' and 'hypnosis' are somewhat interchangeable, although trance can be thought of as a more informal state, while hypnosis tends to be a deliberate process.

For example, a person dancing in a nightclub may experience a trance-like state as they become one with the music and dance in rhythm with the rest of the crowd. A great concert can also produce a trance-like state, as can a captivating conversation with a friend in which time seems to disappear.

If you drive, you are probably familiar with going into a natural trance when driving on the highway. You may also experience this as a passenger staring out the window of a car, train or bus.

**In essence, trance is like a natural state of hypnosis that people go into every day.**

Hypnosis is about taking this natural ability to go into trance and using it purposefully, as in hypnotherapy, where it is used to work directly with the client's subconscious mind.

## Four Definitions of Hypnosis

### Definition 1: Altered State of Awareness (Spiegel, 1972)

"Hypnosis is an altered state of awareness in which the individual withdraws his peripheral awareness and concentrates all attention on a focal goal... is related to the ability to concentrate in an attentive, responsive manner, even to the point of dissociation."

### Definition 2: Communication of Ideas (Erickson & Rossi, 1980)

"Hypnosis is a communication of ideas and understandings to a patient in such a fashion that he will be most receptive to the presented ideas and thereby motivated to explore his own body potentials for the control of his psychological and physiological responses and behaviour."

### Definition 3: Natural State of Mind (NCH)

"Opinions vary on the exact definition of this natural state of mind. First of all, contrary to what many people believe, hypnosis is not always a trance state or a sleep state, even though a person in hypnosis may appear to be sleeping. Hypnosis is really a natural state of mind and is an important part of everyday life. Whenever our mind wanders, daydreams or is focused on something, such as reading a book, driving a familiar route, or watching a film, we are in a state of hypnosis. Brain scans on people who are in a hypnosis state show that brain wave activity moves from a Beta state to an Alpha state, and sometimes a Theta state. This is not dissimilar to the pattern of brain activity during meditation."

### Definition 4: Neural Functioning (Dell, 2017)

In *What is the Essence of Hypnosis?*, author Paul F Dell characterizes hypnosis as "...a motivated mode of neural functioning that enables most humans to alter, to varying degrees, their experience of body, self, actions, and world. The essence of hypnosis is not to be found in hetero-hypnosis; instead, it lies in the spontaneous self-activation of that mode of neural functioning. Moreover, self-activation of trance is the characteristic hypnotic behavior of a distinct subset of highly hypnotizable individuals."

**Note:** *Heterohypnosis* refers to a hypnotic state created in one person by another, including through the use of audio tapes or CDs.

## Key Contributors to Hypnosis

### Milton Erickson (1901-1980)

Erickson pioneered **'indirect hypnosis'**, the subtle language patterns designed to shift the patient's perception of themself and their problems without necessarily resorting to formal, eyes-closed inductions. More importantly, he understood that for hypnotherapy to be truly effective, it needs to be meaningful to the individual. His whole approach was based on understanding and working with the individual client's view of the world.

### Dave Elman (1900-1967)

Elman's book *Hypnotherapy* is regarded as a classic in its field. He pioneered a new approach to induction, moving away from lengthy visualizations and instead using short, sharp induction techniques. Elman challenged the notion that drawn out inductions produce a deeper state of trance. His approach has gained popularity with modern hypnotherapists because of its ability to induce hypnosis, and test for responsiveness, extremely quickly and reliably. RTT® has also adopted a similar approach, favoring a single, rapid induction.

### David Viscott (1938-1996)

Viscott is perhaps less well-known in the field of hypnotherapy. His unorthodox approach involved making a swift diagnosis, which ran contrary to the training he had received as a psychiatrist. His strategy was to try and isolate the source of the client's emotional problems and, once manifest, to work on them rather than employ reflection and drawn out sessions. His goal was to help his clients express their true feelings. Some considered this approach confrontational and overly directive. RTT® has embedded a similar approach in a technique called RFIP, which you will learn about later in the program.

### Gil Boyne (1924-2010)

Gil Boyne is well known for his client-centered Regression Therapy. Gil used regression to help his clients get to the root cause of their problems instead of guessing what the cause of their problems might be.

> "I was lucky enough to study under the great Gil Boyne, who taught me that therapy shouldn't be lengthy, complicated or try to prove theories. Results happen in a single session if you focus on the client's internal problem-solving ability. Boyne's 'Transforming Therapy' believes the inner creative mind not only knows all the questions but also knows all the answers. So great therapists can direct clients to solve their own problems and conflicts."  
> — Marisa Peer (2017)

In their book, *The Art of Hypnotic Regression Therapy: A Clinical Guide* (2012), authors C. Roy Hunter and Bruce N. Elmer describe regression therapy as "...a way for the client to move through time and space and revisit scenes from their past. By revisiting these scenes with the assistance of a hypnotherapist, the client is able to reevaluate what they experienced growing up and reassess the way they interpreted those events as a child. Taking the client back to scenes to find the root cause is one of the most powerful tools that a hypnotherapist can use to understand the impact of the past and how it influences the client's behavior today."

## Direct and Indirect Suggestions

### Direct Suggestions

Direct suggestions are statements that clearly tell the client what to do or what will happen. They are straightforward and explicit commands.

**Examples:**
- "You are now calm and relaxed."
- "Your eyelids are getting heavier."
- "You will sleep soundly tonight."

### Indirect Suggestions

Indirect suggestions are more subtle and allow the client's subconscious mind to interpret and respond in its own way. They often use softer language and presuppositions.

For clients who want to stop smoking, an indirect suggestion could be:

"I wonder how often you'll notice how you take care of yourself every day. And the more you do this, the more confident you are about making the best choices for you. And as you make the best choices, you realize how easy it is to choose to drink water instead of smoking, as it feels so disgusting to you."

#### Types of Indirect Suggestions

- **Presuppositions** – "I'm looking forward to seeing you next week when you'll tell me what insights you've achieved by doing the homework I've set."
- **Embedded commands** – "And you can begin to relax while we're sitting here talking."
- **Negatives** – You state what you want the client to do and precede the statement with 'Don't', as the mind does not recognize the word and picks up on the suggestion, e.g., "Don't have fun today."

### Working with Resistance

The client will always let you know, either verbally or non-verbally, if a suggestion you make is not working. If the client is initially resistant to a direct suggestion, don't assume they will stay that way throughout the session. As you build rapport and they become more open and trusting of the process, you are likely to find they become more responsive to direct suggestions.

**The key is to remain flexible and tuned into the client.**

## Hypnosis Techniques and Suggestibility

> "If your mind can believe something as silly as magnets, just think what it can do with something you really want."  
> — Marisa Peer

### Hypnosis Techniques Overview

There are many hypnosis induction techniques that you can explore: Milton Erikson was the founder of indirect and covert inductions, while Dave Elman's approach was direct and rapid.

Drawing upon her vast experience, Marisa uses a **single rapid induction technique**. The process relies on the client achieving inward focus, relaxation and Rapid Eye Movement (REM).

Before you begin the induction process, you can explain to the client that induction enables access to the subconscious mind. During the induction process, the client is asked to look upward until a slight strain is felt in their eyes. As their eyelids close, they will feel a fluttering sensation which is REM. You should comment on this to the client and point out that they are responding well so that they know the hypnosis is working.

Next, the client is guided down ten steps, becoming more relaxed with each step. Upon reaching the final step, the deepening techniques are used.

### Demonstrating Suggestibility

Demonstrating suggestibility (using 'suggestibility tests') is an effective way to help the client experience the power of imagination and work with their subconscious mind. Demonstrating suggestibility typically takes place at the beginning of a session, but it can be used wherever it is appropriate to do so.

### Induction, Deepeners, and Suggestibility Tests

These three elements are used together to take the client into hypnosis:

**Induction:** The first step toward hypnotizing someone. This process is used to take the client into a state of 'hypnotic trance' in which they are more open to suggestion.

**Deepeners:** Designed to 'deepen' the hypnotic trance. Deepening is another form of suggestion, where 'going deeper' is tied to a cue, e.g., a sound, a command or a physical movement.

**Suggestibility Tests:** Demonstrate to the client that they are suggestible. This increases the client's confidence in the process and their belief that they will achieve their desired outcome. Suggestibility tests can also act like deepeners during the Induction (e.g., the Eye Lock).

## Hypnotherapy and RTT®

### Understanding the Difference

We have taken a look at what hypnotherapy is, but what does it mean for you as you work with clients?

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Your Goals as a Practitioner:** How you operate as an RTT® professional will be driven by your goals for your clients. For example, do you want to help clients eliminate problems, or do you want your clients to have good emotional health in the future?

2. **Individual Client Responses:** Each client will respond very differently depending on their expectations of hypnosis, any past experience with a therapist, and their level of suggestibility.

**Important:** As the therapist, you can shape both these factors.

### Developing Your Practice

You will need to develop strong therapeutic communication skills, such as rapport-building and listening skills. Completing the Communication and Connections module and attending Virtual Classroom sessions will support you with this.

### Summary

The way you practice and value your clients will impact your clients' experience of hypnosis. Each client's experience of hypnosis will be different each time. Some clients may initially tell you it 'didn't work' and then report on significant change.

You must establish what hypnosis/hypnotherapy means to you, as this will influence your approach to your work with clients and how you describe to them what you do.

## Activities

### Activity 1: Direct and Indirect Suggestions

To become more adept at using suggestions, practice writing them. Begin by thinking of the suggestions you want to convey to someone, then experiment with different ways of delivering them.

For each of the following scenarios:
- A client who wants to give up chocolate
- A client who is afraid of birds

Write 10 direct commands and 10 indirect commands.

### Activity 2: Recognizing Suggestions in Media

Watching TV or streamed programs is an excellent way to practice recognizing direct and indirect suggestions. News and political programs are good for this, but even weather reports can contain suggestions!

For example, a weather reporter might say: "And you'll all be feeling great tomorrow as the sun is forecast to shine, and the temperatures rise to warm, comfortable levels."

### Activity 3: Explain the Work You Do

Reflecting on the information you have learned about RTT®, how would you explain RTT® in practice to your family, friends and clients?
