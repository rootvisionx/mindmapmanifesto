# MindMap Manifesto: Strategic Gameplan

This document outlines the hierarchy of mastery and the integrated product ecosystem for the MindMap Manifesto project.

## 1. The Mastery Hierarchy

Everything we create follows a downward pressure of value:

**SKILL > TECHNIQUE > KNOWLEDGE > PRODUCT**

* **SKILL**: **Hypnotherapy**. The core ability to facilitate deep, subconscious change and neurological rewiring.
* **TECHNIQUE**: **The Nazar Protocols**. The tactical "moves" (RFIP, Dimensional Tilting, Reframing) used to focus the Skill.
* **KNOWLEDGE**: **The Dimensional Roadmap**. The theoretical maps (98-State Matrix, Euler’s Signature, Physics of Divinity) that inform the Techniques.
* **PRODUCT**: **The Manifestations**. The containers (ITT, MindMap Manifesto, VOYAGE) that deliver the value to the world.

## 2. The Product Ecosystem

We have productized the core Skill into three distinct layers, each serving a different stage of the user journey:

### A. ITT (Inner Territory Training)

* **The Broadcast Product**
* **Role**: Top-of-funnel education and mass-market demystification.
* **Medium**: YouTube (Shorts/Long-form), Social Media.
* **Objective**: Show the "Triangle can be lifted."

### B. MindMap Manifesto

* **The Systemic Product**
* **Role**: Infrastructure and interactive implementation.
* **Medium**: Searchable Q&A Hubs, Interactive Intake Forms, Unified Session Scripts.
* **Objective**: Provide the "Tools to lift the triangle."

### C. VOYAGE

* **The Journey Product**
* **Role**: High-tier identity transformation and philosophical synthesis.
* **Medium**: The "Highest Self" Codex, deep-dive narrative experiences.
* **Objective**: Reveal "You are the one holding the triangle."

## 3. Synergy & Flow

The products operate as a unified "Downward Spiral" of depth:

1. **Awareness (ITT)**: Viewer encounters a "Mind Hack" Short or a Theory video.
2. **Conversion (MindMap Manifesto)**: User chooses to "Begin Journey" via the interactive intake sequence.
3. **Transformation (MindMap/VOYAGE)**: Client experiences a session using the Unified Script, leading into the deep-dive philosophy of VOYAGE.

## 4. Execution Roadmap (Phases)

### Phase I: Stabilize Infrastructure (Current)

* Standardize RFIP nomenclature.
* Complete Module 11 (Common Issues) content.
* Finalize Unified Intake and Session scripts.

### Phase II: Content Broadcast

* Execute the [YouTube Action Plan](file:///Users/rootv/mindmapmanifesto/mindmapmanifesto/tools/youtube_action_plan.md).
* Create "Technique" focus videos derived from the Nazar protocols.

### Phase III: Deep Integration

* Consolidate VOYAGE and ITT into a single membership/training platform.
* Finalize the "39 Lessons" curriculum.
