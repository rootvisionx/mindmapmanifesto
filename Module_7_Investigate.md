# RTT® Module 7: The 4 I's - Investigate

## Module Learning Outcomes

In this module, you will:

- Understand the role of the consultation (Intake) in an RTT® session and know its key components
- Investigate the client's presenting problem and desired outcome using a range of questioning techniques
- Induce hypnosis, making use of techniques (suggestibility tests and deepeners) and demonstrating relevant pace and use of voice
- Know the purpose of The Detective Work and its role within an RTT® session
- Explore feelings within the scenes by gathering and linking relevant information (feelings and keywords)
- Make use of a range of questioning techniques
- Understand the role of the Child in the Room tool, and use it effectively within a session

## Why is the Investigate Stage Important?

Investigating is about helping the client understand the root cause of their issue and identifying the meaning they have attached to the events from their past which have caused limiting beliefs. Investigation begins during the Intake by finding out what the client wants (What You Want/Magic Wand, Life Without the Problem) and what's preventing them from having that (Symptoms/Triggers/Habits, Childhood).

### Tools Used in This Stage

- Setting the Client Up for Success
- The Intake
- Induction, Suggestibility Tests and Deepeners
- The Detective Work (Finding the Root Cause)
- Child in the Room

### What Are You Hoping to Achieve in the Investigate Stage?

- To understand what the client's presenting problem is, when and where it shows up in their life, and how it affects them
- To discover what the client wants and what life without the problem will look like for them
- To uncover the root cause of the client's presenting problem and why their issue started

## Setting the Client Up for Success

> *"Everything I'm teaching today, I didn't learn from a book. And I didn't learn it from my own brilliant teacher. I learned everything from my clients."* — Marisa Peer

The purpose of setting the client up for success is to:

- Put the client at ease
- Demonstrate to the client that they are suggestible
- Address the client's fears and misconceptions
- Set expectations about the session

Many clients come to RTT® feeling anxious about hypnosis and misinformed about what hypnosis is. Your role is to put them at ease and reassure them that RTT® will work for them. 

Marisa calls it 'setting the client up for success'. You may also hear this referred to as 'convincers'. This word references our need to demonstrate to the client that they are suggestible and for them to believe this is the case. If the client can believe something as insignificant as magnets in their hands attracting together, they will be receptive to other suggestions that are in their self-interest.

Your assumption as an RTT® professional should be that it will always work. Clients need to be confident in order to achieve sustainable results, and much can be done before the Induction begins. In fact, it is safe to say that this may be the most critical time to create success - by speaking to the client's fears and misconceptions and discussing what they can expect from a session.

### Ways to Set the Client Up for Success

**Set Realistic Expectations**
Outline what the client wants and what is possible for them to achieve. Catch any discrepancies between what the client wants to achieve and what you may want to achieve for them.

**Cultural Competence**
Be careful not to make assumptions about the client based on their background, or make comments or suggestions that may not resonate with them because of their culture.

**Rapport**
Ensure that you have established rapport with the client. A lack of connection will cause unconscious resistance in the client.

**Empathy**
Clients will sense when you don't empathize with them. This can cause them to become defensive as a protection mechanism.

**Communication Skills**
Practice your essential communication skills, e.g., active and reflective listening. These will make it easier for the client to open up to you.

**Be Careful Not to Overdisclose**
Be careful not to disclose too much about your personal life or your work with other clients. If you do, the client may be reluctant to share their private information with you.

**Select Appropriate Tools**
If a tool doesn't fit where the client is in the process or is used in a way that doesn't honor the client, this could affect their responsiveness.

**Session Pace**
Align the pace of a session with the client's pace. Aim to match their overall pace. Speaking too fast or too slow may cause the client to believe you cannot adapt to their needs, and, as a result, the client may become less responsive. Find the perfect balance.

**Maintain a Professional Appearance and Environment**
Practice proper hygiene, dress professionally, and ensure your environment reflects the professional atmosphere you wish to communicate to your clients.

**Make the Client Feel Comfortable**
Promote a social atmosphere. Make the client feel comfortable. An environment that feels too formal or rigid will cause clients to respond in a similar way. Provide a warm, welcoming space where clients will naturally want to open up to you.

### What to Do When the Client First Comes Into the Session

When the client arrives at the session, it is important to narrow down the issue within the first 10 minutes. It is your job to find out what they want.

Clients are very good at telling you what they DON'T want.

Using the Intake and Consultation form, ask the client to circle everything they are concerned about; it is easy for clients to forget some things in the moment.

#### Key Questions to Ask

- "What do you want?"
- "What do you want to get from this session?"
- "If this was a magic wand, and you could have one wish...."
- "When you leave here, what is the outcome you want?"
- "If I could grant you one wish, what would it be?"

Finding the answers quickly is vital so that you don't waste valuable time talking about the client's history, which may or may not be relevant. The client needs to be sure that you know exactly what they want and feel confident that you will give it to them. It is important to take brief notes so that later, during the Transformation, you can repeat what they want using THEIR words.

At this stage, you may not even fully understand what the client wants, but they will feel so confident when you repeat it back to them exactly as they put it. Being very specific in this way excites the client's mind and builds their confidence in you.

### Useful Pointers When Talking to Clients

**About the Hypnotic State**
Many clients come to us believing that being in hypnosis will be markedly different from their 'normal' state of consciousness. This may be based on what they have seen of stage hypnotists. However, the light trance/hypnotic state feels very much like the normal state of relaxation. In fact, the client will feel more aware in hypnosis. You can say, "Don't expect to feel hypnotized; it is a natural state." There is no right or wrong way to experience hypnosis. You don't go anywhere, and many people don't even realize they are in hypnosis until they come out of it.

Hypnosis is a natural state where you feel increasing levels of relaxation because it is suggested to you to feel relaxed.

**About Control**
During the Induction, the client needs to know that they are in control. For example, if you told a client to stand up, they would do it. But if you told them to rob a bank, they would not. Well, it's the same in hypnosis - the client is in control.

The client will only accept the suggestions given to them if they feel it is in their interests to do so. Remember, you are working with the client's internal values and beliefs, which you are actively trying to change.

## The Intake and Consultation

### The Consultation

The consultation (Page 1 of the Intake and Consultation form) enables you to collect the client's personal information, contact details, medical history, and any areas of concern the client wants to work on.

Completing these questions fully and accurately allows you to assess the client's needs and determine their eligibility for RTT®. For example, some medical conditions will fall outside your scope of practice and mean you cannot work with a client.

During the consultation, it is essential that you confirm the following:

- The client does not have any history of psychosis
- The client does not have epilepsy

The areas of concern that the client ticks/circles provide a comprehensive picture of the issues they are experiencing and allow you to see which issues may be linked.

You must complete the consultation in the session.

#### Conditions That Fall Outside RTT® Scope

While Rapid Transformational Therapy® (RTT®) has proved effective in treating some mental health issues, such as eating disorders and phobias, it is not advisable for RTT® professionals to treat clients with psychosis. Individuals with psychosis should consult their GP for further advice.

If a client discloses any of the conditions/symptoms listed below, you must not see them for RTT®. Hypnosis may exacerbate their symptoms and/or worsen their condition, causing more harm than good.

- Auditory/visual hallucinations
- Epilepsy
- Dissociative disorders
- Personality disorders
- Psychosis
- Schizoaffective disorder
- Schizophrenia

### The Intake

The purpose of the Intake is to obtain information relating to the client's presenting problem and their desired outcome using a range of questioning styles. (The Session Notes feature on Page 2 of the Intake and Consultation form.)

The fundamental objective of this part of the Intake is to extract key feelings and reactions around the presenting problem so that when the client is in hypnosis, you can access the root cause effectively using their language.

Think of the Intake as collecting information from the client's conscious mind. The rest of the session is about working with the client's subconscious mind.

Asking great questions around What You Want (WYW) and Life Without the Problem (LWTP) is vital as these will help you create a bespoke Transformation.

During the Intake, you will take notes about the client's:
- Presenting Problem (PP)
- Symptoms, Triggers and Habits (STH)
- Childhood (CH)
- What You Want/Magic Wand (WYW/MW)
- Life Without the Problem (LWTP)

When you use the Intake and Consultation form, highlight the client's keywords so that you can read them back to the client during the Transformation.

The purpose of the Intake is to understand how the client's issue presents itself in their life. It will also create a foundation of knowledge that you will refer to throughout the session and use to make the client's Transformation recording.

### Important Notes About Medical Information

Having a record of the client's medical information is essential. You will need this in case of an emergency or if you have to coordinate care with the client's doctor (or other medical practitioners). You also need to know about any medications the client is taking. Some medications may inhibit the success of a session (e.g., if the client takes medication that makes it difficult for them to focus).

### Working with One Problem at a Time

Work on one presenting problem at a time. Use the Magic Wand question: "If I had a magic wand, and I could grant you one wish, what would it be?" This question will help the client determine the most important issue for them to work on.

### When to Complete the Intake

It is recommended that you take the client through the Intake in person, although you may want to send them an Intake and Consultation form to complete ahead of their session.

If you send the client an Intake and Consultation form prior to their session, ensure you go through each of their responses in the session and ask any clarifying questions you may have.

### Questioning Techniques

Questioning techniques play a crucial role in gathering information from clients during the consultation and Intake process.

**Closed Questions**
A closed question can only be answered with 'yes' or 'no'. This type of question should be avoided during the Intake (and during RTT® sessions in general), although it is useful in confirming information with the client.

Example: "Did I just hear you say that you tend to beat yourself up if you don't get things perfect?"

**Open Questions**
An open question cannot be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no' response; the client must provide a longer, more detailed response.

Example: "And how does that make you feel?"

Asking closed questions is like throwing darts and hoping you'll hit the target. Asking open questions allows the client to paint a picture for you.

#### Question Types

**What? When? Where? How?**

Examples:
- How often do you experience [X]?
- How severe does [X] get?
- What is the impact of experiencing [X] when you're [Y]?
- What does [X] stop you from doing?

**Probing Questions** help you get more specific information from clients.

Examples:
- Is there a particular time of day when [X] happens?
- Can you tell me more about [X]?

**Clarifying Questions** can be used to gather more detail.

Examples:
- How would it feel to explore [X] a little more deeply?
- How would it feel to go back and speak to your mother about that?

**Encouraging Questions** are used when dealing with the emotional aspects of a client's life.

Examples:
- And when you feel [X], how do you respond?
- When you think about [X], what happens?

**Linking Questions** are used to help make connections.

### Ear Prick-Up Moments and Trigger Words

When asking the client questions, it is important to listen out for any ear prick-up moments or trigger words.

By paying attention to people's trigger words and identifying ear prick-up moments, you will become a better listener. You will also start to hear patterns emerge in the way people speak. When you notice these patterns, get curious; this will improve your detective skills and help your clients get to the root cause in sessions.

**Trigger Words**
Trigger words, also known as keywords, are the negative and positive words the client uses to express their feelings or beliefs. Sometimes the client's trigger words include metaphors.

Examples: Hurt, confident, resilient, out of control, small, stuck, surrounded by a black cloud.

**Ear Prick-Up Moments**
Ear prick-up moments occur when the client's words or phrases pique your curiosity. This could be something the client shares that seems unusual or out of place. Sometimes, a recurring word, phrase, pattern or theme may emerge as the client expresses themself.

Examples:
- The client may start by telling you, "I was close to my brother," then, later, say, "I think we were close."
- The client uses a phrase repeatedly, e.g., "It weighs me down."

## Induction, Suggestibility Tests and Deepeners

### Overview

**Induction Into Hypnosis**
Taking the client into hypnosis using a single rapid induction that combines REM, inward focus and relaxation, beginning to access the client's subconscious mind.

**Suggestibility Tests (When the Client is in Hypnosis)**
Demonstrating to the client how suggestible they are in hypnosis. Using a suggestibility test like Bucket and Balloon (where you suggest to the client that one of their arms feels as if it's tied to a balloon floating high up into the air and their other arm feels like a heavy bucket is pulling it down).

**Deepening Techniques**
Taking the client deeper into hypnosis, where they feel more relaxed and their conscious mind is bypassed even further.

The Induction, suggestibility tests and deepeners are used together to take clients into hypnosis. Suggestibility tests and deepeners act as supporting elements to the Induction.

### 1. The Induction

The first step toward hypnotizing the client is the Induction. This process is used to take the client into a state where they are more open to suggestion, also known as a 'hypnotic trance'.

### 2. Suggestibility Tests

Suggestibility tests demonstrate to the client that they are suggestible. This increases the client's confidence in the process and their belief that they will be successful in achieving their outcome. Suggestibility tests can also act like deepeners during the Induction (e.g., the Eye Lock).

> *"If your mind can believe something as silly as magnets, just think what it can do with something you really want."* — Marisa Peer

Suggestibility tests are an effective way to help your clients experience the power of their imagination and of working with the subconscious mind. Demonstrating suggestibility typically takes place at the beginning of a session but may be used wherever it is appropriate to do so.

### 3. Deepeners

Deepeners are designed to deepen the hypnotic trance. Deepening is another form of suggestion in which 'going deeper' is tied to a cue, e.g., a sound, a command, or a physical movement.

An important part of taking the client into hypnosis involves using deepeners (during the Induction). The purpose of using deepeners is to relax the client's conscious mind and help them achieve a more focused state of concentration. This allows the client to become more open and receptive to your suggestions.

Deepeners include:

- **Clicking Your Fingers:** Clicking your fingers and telling the client to, "Go deeper."
- **Hypnotic Surrender:** Pushing the client's hands down into their lap (once they've touched) during the Magnetic Hands suggestibility test.
- **Arm Drop:** Gently lifting the client's arm, then dropping it back into their lap and saying, "Go deeper." (This is done two to three times)
- **Eye Lock:** Telling the client their eyes are 'glued shut, sealed shut, locked tight.'
- **Head Rock:** Gently rocking the client's head back and forth (for no longer than 10 seconds) and telling them, "The neck muscles are the first to tighten and the last to relax." You're testing to make sure their neck muscles are loose at this point.

### Commands in the Induction

A command can be direct or indirect.

**Direct commands** are more obvious. For example, "Your eyelids are starting to feel...."

**Indirect commands** are more likely to be found hidden within a sentence. For example, "Each time you [X], that means [Y]" or "Whenever you [X], you feel [Y]." You are still telling the client what is going to happen, but it is slightly less authoritative.

RTT® is almost entirely direct in approach, but you will find aspects of indirect suggestion embedded throughout the Induction and Deepeners Script.

### Alternative Visualizations

**What if a client has vertigo or doesn't like steps?**

You could get the client to imagine walking along a wooden deck on a beach or a pathway in a beautiful garden.

Alternatively, you could ask the client to imagine being in an elevator/lift traveling down each of the ten floors.

Just ensure whatever setting you choose is easy for the client to visualize and is somewhere they will feel relaxed.

### If Client Opens Eyes in Induction

If the client opens their eyes, point out that, even though they could open their eyes, it may have been harder to do, or their eyes may have seemed sticky. Make sure you observe if this is the case.

If it is not the case, treat the opening of their eyes as something completely normal. Say, "That's right, now just close your eyes and go deeper."

The client may feel the need to be in control. If so, remind them that they will always remain in control throughout the process. Tell the client they are capable of opening their eyes at any time but that you want them to close their eyes and follow your suggestions.

### Summary

- It is essential that clients believe in the power of the mind. Using suggestibility tests is a practical way to demonstrate to clients their mind's ability to imagine and respond to suggestion.
- Marisa has drawn upon her vast experience to create a single, rapid induction.
- The purpose of the Induction is to help clients achieve a state of relaxation, inward focus and Rapid Eye Movement (REM).
- Deepeners are used to encourage a deeper trance.
- Using deepeners will help clients achieve a deeper state of relaxation and sideline the critical mind.

## The Detective Work (Finding the Root Cause)

> *"Part of the power of the Detective Work is to give your client an understanding that frees them. Telling them that they were acting in an age-appropriate way, you free them."* — Marisa Peer

### Purpose

During the Detective Work you will:

- Take the client back to the root cause of their problem (the underlying belief(s))
- Help the client to understand how a particular issue came into their life
- Assist the client to review and make connections between the scenes from their past

### Overview

Doing the Detective Work is an important part of an RTT® session. This is how we get to the Root Cause (the underlying belief). The Detective Work is used in almost every session.

Doing the Detective Work and Daisy Chaining is how we get to the Root Cause (the underlying beliefs) that a client formed earlier in life. It is about taking your clients back to how, when and where an issue/problem started.

Root Cause is instrumental in understanding a negative or misinterpreted belief. You will guide your clients to safely review the root cause of their issue/problem, understand it, and then to transform those beliefs. Marisa says that understanding is power and once clients understand the basis of a barrier they can also free themselves from its grip.

Clients need to understand how a particular behavior became a part of their life in order to challenge that behavior and find a more appropriate response. Your purpose is to guide your client to significant events and experiences from earlier in their life that contribute to their presenting problem.

During the Detective Work, it is important to go to at least 3 scenes making a connection between those scenes and back to the presenting issue.

The last scene is usually the most significant or emotionally intense.

Clients don't always have to go back to scenes in their childhood. Overall they will because our behavior is set by the time we're seven. At the same time, someone can have a wonderful life and then something bad happens and they become depressed.

### Establishing the Scene

When taking the client to a scene, ask:

- This scene where you are now, is it daytime or nighttime?
- Are you inside or outside?
- Are you alone or with others?
- How old are you?

Then:
1. Explore the scene
2. Ask the client to let the scene fade

**If your client doesn't know what age they are, ask:**

"Are you more than five, or less than five?"

If they say, "More," ask: "Are you more than eight or less than eight?"

If they say, "Less," ask: "Are you more than seven or less than seven?"

### Managing Abreactions

An abreaction is when a client is reliving a scene that may be distressing or uncomfortable for them. Your role is to move clients to a safe space where they can continue to review the scene from a distance.

Tell them the following to manage their reaction:

- You are reviewing the scene (as if on a computer screen) not reliving it
- You are in a safe space with me and the event is in the past
- You are in control
- Breathe deeply and remain calm

Note: Some clients may shake or cry and this reaction should be acknowledged not suppressed. Allowing the feeling to come to the fore is part of the process of releasing and letting go and you can tell your clients this while supporting them during the session.

### About Past Lives

Marisa says that there are three different ways to consider past lives:

1. **Post-intergenerational stress disorder** - where you've inherited your ancestor's fears (e.g., having a grandparent who was a slave and having that passed down through the generations leaves you with a fear of authority)

2. You've read history books and they've fascinated you and because you've studied it, it's wired itself into you and it's come back

3. It's real - some people really do go back and have past lives

It doesn't matter if past lives are real or not; if your client thinks they're real, that's all that matters.

If you're doing a regular RTT® session and one of the three scenes is from another lifetime, just throw it into the mix. Your job is not to make your clients feel bad; it's your job to make them feel good and allow them to make the connection from all of the scenes (including any scenes from a past life) with the present.

### What to Do When There Are No Scenes

Rarely, if ever, clients will not go back to scenes during 'The Detective Work'.

If your client does not regress back to scenes, what you should **never** say is:
- "You're not ready for change."
- "You're just resistant."
- "You need to go away and come back later."

#### Steps to Follow

**Step 1: Ask "What Are You Feeling/Hearing?"**

If the client does not see a scene, ask: "What are you feeling? You can remember it like it was yesterday."

You can build the scene from there based on the information the client provides. For example, sometimes the client may be in darkness, or even in the womb.

You can also say: "Your ears are wide open, what do you hear happening (or being said) all around you?"

If there is no feeling and they do not hear anything, move on to Step 2.

**Step 2: Say to your client: "That was just a rehearsal"**

"In a moment I'm going to count back from 5 all the way down to 1 and your brilliant, brilliant mind is going to take you back to a vivid, vital, absolutely crucial scene that has everything to do with the (physical/emotional issue)."

If there is still no scene, move on to Step 3 and/or Step 4.

Some examples of what your client might say include:
- "I'm not getting the root cause."
- "Nothing is happening."
- "I'm just here."
- "I'm talking to you and I'm nowhere."

Note: Never try to go back to a scene more than twice if the client tells you they are 'nowhere.'

**Step 3: Go to 'Child in the Room'**

Say: "That's okay. That's so common. It happens all the time. Your mind is getting used to the technique and the process and feeling safe; but this time, as I count back, we're now going to do something called 'Child in the Room' which you will love, and it's so easy."

Note: The worst thing you can do is say, "Oh, well - never mind," or, "Let's do it a third time," or say, "Well, you need to try harder," or, "Let's do it again."

Never make them feel, 'This is failing,' 'I'm not getting it right,' 'You're not getting it right.'

Seamlessly say, "This is all absolutely normal. We're moving straight into Child in the Room."

**Step 4: Alternatively, go into Role, Function, Purpose, Intention**

When you ask the client how old they were when the part came into their life and what was happening, this can be used as a scene.

### Summary

- The Detective Work is used in almost every session
- The Detective Work is about taking the client back to how, when and where an issue/problem started
- When doing the detective work, always bear in mind what the client's presenting problem is. Each scene is like a piece of a puzzle that connect together within the client's mind relating to their issue
- Welcome diversions. The most rewarding adventures often start with an unexpected detour. Perhaps that distraction will guide you onward
- Clients do not always have to go back to scenes in their childhood. But in most cases they do because our behavior is set by the time we are 7 years old
- The purpose of the Detective Work is to uncover the feelings, beliefs, meaning and interpretation the client has attached to events from their past
- Marisa will sometimes refer to the Detective Work as 'Root Cause' or, formerly, 'Regression'

## Child in the Room

> *"You must feel the feeling until it no longer requires to be felt."* — Marisa Peer

### Overview

Child in the Room:

- Is another form of The Detective Work
- Is used when a client finds it difficult to go back to scenes
- Would also be classed as Scene 1 within The Detective Work
- The key objective of Child in the Room is to get to the scenes
- Guides the client through a visualization that connects them to their feelings and reveals the beliefs they developed as a child

This is another form of Detective Work to be used when a client's scenes are unclear or if the client says they don't see anything. It is a guided visualization that connects a client to their emotions so that they are able to trigger memories of events/ideas/feelings from earlier in their life.

### Key Steps to Child in the Room

1. Ask the client to imagine drifting all the way back to the home they grew up in between the ages of 2 and 10

2. If they grew up in more than one home, tell them that their mind will take them where they need to go

3. Get them to imagine floating through the front door and all the way up to the door of the room they grew up in as a child

4. Ask the client to imagine making their way into this room, where they can greet a smaller, younger version of themselves

5. Tell the client that they have a complete affinity with their younger self and that their younger self knows who they are (even though the client is now an adult)

6. Tell the client that their younger self will be able to answer any questions you or the client may have for them

7. Get the client to ask the child, "Are you happy or sad? What is it that makes you feel happy/sad?"

8. Explore the feelings/beliefs that emerge

9. Option: Treat Child in the Room as Scene 1 and proceed with the Detective Work for Scenes 2 and Scene 3

### A Place of Safety

> *"One of the things with children is, their bed is their safe place. Their bedroom is where they can go to be safe. For instance, in a fire, many children get into the bed or under the bed. Many children who are abused get into their bed. It's their place of safety. When you take the client back to their bedroom, you're taking them back to something they will always know, and it's safe."* — Marisa Peer

### Key Language in Child in the Room

**Therapist asks:** "What does mommy (or daddy) do or not do that makes you unhappy?"

**Client might respond:**
- She isn't there
- She's got a new boyfriend
- She's got a new baby
- She's always working
- She's always crying
- She's always shouting

**Therapist continues:** "And you feel (feeling) because..."

**Client might respond:**
- Because I am not enough
- I can't fix it
- It must be my fault when mommy's always shouting
- I feel helpless and hopeless

### Options After Revealing Feelings

When a client has started to reveal their feelings, you have two options:

**Option 1: Go straight into the Detective Work (Going Back to the Root Cause)**

For example, when a client starts to reveal their feelings, say, "And let's now go to a scene to do with the first time you felt that feeling of being abandoned."

**Option 2: Stay with the Child in the Room and ask more questions:**

- "How old were you when that happened?"
- "How old were you when you began to feel that nobody loved you?"
- "How old were you when this bullying started?"
- "What else was going on when this happened?"

Child in the Room would also be classed as Scene 1 within The Detective Work.

### How to Start Child in the Room

You ask your client to ask the child: "Are you happy?"

They respond immediately: "No."

You get them to ask the child: "What is it that makes you unhappy?"

They respond: "Mommy."

You continue: "Ask the child, 'What is it that Mommy does or doesn't do that makes you feel unhappy?'"

The child responds: "She shouts at me. She prefers my brother. She spends time with him, but she doesn't spend time with me."

As you continue to dig deeper, you discover that your client believes:
- "I don't matter."
- "I'm not enough."
- "I'm insignificant."
- "I'm worthless."

Marisa says, "Your job is to help the client identify that feeling, make sense of that feeling, understand why, when, where they got it; and then move onto the next stage, which is getting rid of it."

"Your job is like that of a detective. Get the feelings. Look at the feelings, change the feelings, and when you do that, you will change your client's life."

### Helping the Client Identify the Location of a Feeling

Many of our clients say, "Yes, I feel the feeling; I need to eat/drink/Netflix that feeling; I need to shop/eBay/Krispy Kreme donut that feeling", because they are pushing what they are feeling down.

Your client may also use metaphors as a way to express their emotions and beliefs. These metaphors are key 'ear-prick up' moments and trigger words that you can use to identify feelings, beliefs and emotions.

As a therapist, your job is to help the client really identify that feeling.

**Examples of locations of feelings and metaphors:**

- "It's in my head, my thoughts just spiral out of control"
- "I have a stutter, I open my mouth but I can't find the words to express myself"
- "It's in my chest, it feels like a huge weight"
- "It's in my tummy, stomach clenches like it is tied in knots"

## Competency Self-Assessment Guidelines

### The Intake: Competency Levels

**Developing Competency:**
- Need to narrow down to one PP
- Questions should be specific to PP
- Move from closed to open questions
- Keep conversation relevant
- LWTP should be developed and specific to the client's desired outcome
- Need to pick up on relevant (key) words

**Attaining Competency:**
- Has identified PP but it may be vaguely articulated
- Asks relevant questions but could probe further in some areas
- WYW/MW is positive but could be more specific
- LWTP has some descriptive and specific language but could be more detailed
- Some relevant language and keywords identified throughout

**Excelling Competency:**
- Demonstrates the ability to clearly identify one PP
- Very clear, specific questions related to the requirements of the Intake form and picks up on keywords or important information
- WYW/MW is specific and positive
- LWTP is detailed, descriptive and positive (e.g., includes what the client wants to see themself doing, seeing, feeling and experiencing)

### The Detective Work: Competency Levels

**Developing Competency:**
- Lead into the scene with PP
- Focus on the feelings
- Develop the use of questioning so your questions are relevant and targeted
